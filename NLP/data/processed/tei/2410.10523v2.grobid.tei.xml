<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preface</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Aim and Overview</head><p>The aim of these notes is to demonstrate the potential for ideas in machine learning to impact on the fields of inverse problems and data assimilation. The perspective is one that is primarily aimed at researchers from inverse problems and/or data assimilation who wish to see a mathematical presentation of machine learning as it pertains to their fields. As a by-product, we include a succinct mathematical treatment of various fundamental underpinning topics in machine learning, and adjacent areas of (computational) mathematics. The fundamental underpinning material is summarized in Part III. Part I of the notes is concerned with inverse problems, employing material from Part III; Part II of the notes is concerned with data assimilation, employing material from Parts I and III. There are different ways to learn from these notes, and consequently there are competing ways in which the material can naturally be organized, from a pedagogical perspective. In particular, as presented here, the material allows application-oriented readers to proceed directly to the use of machine learning methodology, in either (or both) of inverse problems (Part I) and data assimilation (Part II), dipping into the fundamental material in Part III only as it arises and is used. Theory-oriented readers may instead prefer to work through the fundamentals in Part III first and, having absorbed this material, study the applications of machine learning from Parts I and II. Collectively we have taught from these notes in both ways and both have their merits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overarching Concepts and Underpinning Fundamental Ideas</head><p>Parts I and II, concerning inverse problems and data assimilation respectively, are organized to parallel one another. Both start with the introductory Chapters 1 and 6, framing the fields of inverse problems and data assimilation respectively. We adopt a Bayesian perspective, deriving optimization approaches from it. There are then four overarching concepts that define the parallel organization of material in Parts I and II. In Chapters 2 and 7 we discuss the use of ideas from variational Bayes to approximate probability measures from within tractable, and ideally expressive for the task at hand, subclasses of probability measures. Chapters 3 and 8 study the machine learning of prior models, from data. In Chapters 4 and 9 we focus on transport as a unifying concept for the learning of algorithms in inverse problems and data assimilation respectively. Chapters 5 and 10 discuss amortization, demonstrating how the machine learning ideas developed previously, and in particular transport based methods, can be generalized to learn dependence on the observations that define the inverse problems or data assimilation task.</p><p>The key underpinning fundamental ideas used in these notes are contained in Part III. In Chapter 11 we study metrics, divergences and scoring rules. The first two provide ways of quantifying closeness of two probability measures; scoring rules assign a notion of closeness to a probability measure and to a point and, through averaging, can also be used to construct divergences. These notions of closeness are used in two primary ways: to measure robustness of probability measures to perturbations in problem specification; and to define objective functions used in machine learning. Chapter 12 is devoted to supervised learning, focusing on the use of neural networks, random features and Gaussian processes to approximate functions from data. Chapter 13 is devoted to the topics of unsupervised learning and generative modeling; in particular we introduce the use of transport as an important way of framing, and actioning, many tasks in unsupervised learning and generative modeling. In Chapter 14 we discuss time-series forecasting. Much of this material is fundamental to new emerging methods for purely data-driven data assimilation. The ideas in this chapter are important for understanding the current landscape of data assimilation research, but not our focus when studying machine learning for data assimilation in Part II; this is because purely data-driven methods are rapidly evolving and not yet as established as methods that combine modeland data-driven approaches. Chapter 15 describes optimization and sampling techniques that are broadly useful for defining algorithms in the fields of inverse problems and data assimilation. Optimization also plays a fundamental role in machine learning methods for inverse problems and data assimilation, since it is used for training machine learning models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Existing Review Articles</head><p>This is a rapidly evolving research area and there are already several articles that review aspects of the material we will cover. See, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[25]</ref> for uses of ML in inverse problems, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">106]</ref> and Chapter 10 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[96]</ref> for uses of ML in data assimilation. For background on neural networks and deep learning see <ref type="bibr" target="#b199">[179]</ref>; for background on Gaussian processes see <ref type="bibr" target="#b466">[446]</ref>. For an overview of metrics and divergences, and their inter-relations, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b191">[171]</ref>; for a recent overview of scoring rules see <ref type="bibr" target="#b454">[434]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prerequisites</head><p>Even though the subjects of inverse problems and data assimilation are succinctly reviewed in these notes, there remains an assumption of previous knowledge of these topics. The book <ref type="bibr" target="#b398">[378]</ref> (also available in closely related form on arXiv) provides a good background on these topics, and we have tried to maintain similar notation. These notes also assume familiarity with linear algebra, probability, statistics, multivariable calculus, and matrix calculus; we establish notation in these areas in the following subsection. Useful graduate-level references on the topics of linear algebra, probability and statistics include <ref type="bibr" target="#b436">[416,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b206">186,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b459">439]</ref>. We also refer the reader to books on inverse problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">[139,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b254">234,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b449">429]</ref> and data assimilation <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b382">362,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b290">270]</ref>, that provide additional expositions on these topics from the mathematical and computational perspectives. And lastly we refer to the texts <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b256">236,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b309">289,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b433">413]</ref> which cover inverse problems and data assimilation from more applications-oriented perspectives.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Notation</head><p>Throughout the notes we adopt the following notational conventions:</p><p>• Sets. N denotes the set of positive integers {1, 2, 3, . . .}, and Z + := N ∪ {0} = {0, 1, 2, 3, . . .} denotes the set of non-negative integers. R 𝑑 denotes the set of 𝑑-dimensional real vectors, and R + denotes the non-negative reals. The set 𝐵(𝑢, 𝛿) ⊂ R 𝑑 denotes the open ball of radius 𝛿 at 𝑢 in R 𝑑 , in the Euclidean norm. The symbol ∅ denotes the empty set.</p><p>• Vector Spaces Given 𝑢 ∈ R 𝑑 we define 𝑢 -𝑖 ∈ R 𝑑-1 by 𝑢 -𝑖 := (𝑢 1 , . . . , 𝑢 𝑖-1 , 𝑢 𝑖+1 , . . . , 𝑢 𝑑 ) ∈ R 𝑑-1 ;</p><p>we make the natural modification if 𝑖 ∈ {1, 𝑑}. The symbol 𝐼 𝑑 ∈ R 𝑑×𝑑 denotes the identity matrix on R 𝑑 , and Id denotes the identity mapping. We denote the Euclidean norm on R 𝑑 by | • |, noting that it is induced by the inner-product ⟨𝑎, 𝑏⟩ = 𝑎 ⊤ 𝑏. We also use | • | to denote the induced norm on matrices and | • | 𝐹 to denote the Frobenius norm.</p><p>We say that symmetric matrix 𝐴 is positive definite (resp. positive semi-definite) if ⟨𝑢, 𝐴𝑢⟩ is positive (resp. non-negative) for all 𝑢 ̸ = 0, sometimes denoting this by 𝐴 &gt; 0 (resp. 𝐴 ≥ 0). We let R 𝑑×𝑑 sym denote the subset of symmetric matrices in R 𝑑×𝑑 and R 𝑑×𝑑 sym,&gt; the subset of positive definite symmetric matrices and R 𝑑×𝑑 and R 𝑑×𝑑 sym,≥ the subset of positive semidefinite symmetric matrices. We use ≺ (resp. ⪯) to denote ordering between matrices in the cone of positive definite (resp. semidefinite) symmetric matrices. Likewise we use ≻ and ⪰ . We often wish to use covariance-weighted inner-product and norm and, to this end, for covariance matrix 𝐴 &gt; 0, we define</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">|𝑣| 2 𝐴 = 𝑣 ⊤ 𝐴 -1 𝑣. This norm | • | 𝐴 is induced by the weighted Euclidean inner-product ⟨• , •⟩ 𝐴 := ⟨• , 𝐴 -1 •⟩.</formula><p>The outer product ⊗ between two vectors 𝑎, 𝑏 ∈ R 𝑑 is defined by the following identity, assumed to hold for all vectors 𝑐 ∈ R 𝑑 : (𝑎 ⊗ 𝑏)𝑐 = ⟨𝑏, 𝑐⟩𝑎. We also use ⊗ to denote the Kronecker product between matrices. We use det and Tr to denote the determinant and trace functions on matrices. We use vec(•) to denote the vectorization operation on matrices. The Kronecker delta is 𝛿 𝑖𝑗 = 1 for 𝑖 = 𝑗 and 0 otherwise.</p><p>• Probability Unless otherwise stated, throughout these notes random variables take values in Euclidean space. Any such random variable has probability distribution defined by a probability measure, say 𝜇, on Euclidean space. We will mainly consider probability measures that are characterized by a probability density function, say 𝜌, with respect to Lebesgue measure. For this reason we will sometimes blur the distinction between probability measures and probability density functions. In particular, when a random variable 𝑢 has probability density function 𝜌 we will write 𝑢 ∼ 𝜌 rather than 𝑢 ∼ 𝜇. We write i.i.d. for independent and identically distributed.</p><p>Occasionally we will need to employ Dirac measures. In this context we will use the notational convention that the Dirac measure at point 𝑣 has "density" 𝛿(• -𝑣), also denoted by 𝛿 𝑣 (•). A particular use of Dirac measures arises in the construction of an empirical measure, approximating another measure 𝜇: if {𝑣 (𝑛) } 𝑁 𝑛=1 ∼ 𝜇 are i.i.d. then we may form an empirical approximation of 𝜇 as 1</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>𝑁</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>∑︀ 𝑁 𝑛=1 𝛿 𝑣 (𝑛) .</head><p>A centered random variable is a random variable with mean zero. Similarly, a probability density function 𝜌 is called centered if 𝑢 ∼ 𝜌 is a centered random variable. Given probability density function 𝜌, defined on R 𝑑𝑧 , and function 𝑔 : R 𝑑𝑧 → R 𝑑 , 𝜌 𝑔 denotes the probability density function of the random variable 𝑔(𝑧) where 𝑧 ∼ 𝜌. We refer to 𝜌 𝑔 as the pushforward of 𝜌 under 𝑔 and write 𝜌 𝑔 as 𝑔 ♯ 𝜌. Formally the pushforward notation 𝜌 𝑔 = 𝑔 ♯ 𝜌 means that P 𝜌𝑔 (𝐴) = P 𝜌 (𝑔 -1 (𝐴)) for any Borel set 𝐴. We note that, in some other texts, the pushforward is denoted by 𝑔#𝜌 = 𝜌 𝑔 or 𝑔 ⋆ 𝜌 = 𝜌 𝑔 .</p><p>We denote by P(•), P(• | •) the probability density function of a random variable and its conditional probability density function, respectively. For jointly varying random variables (𝑢, 𝑣) we let 𝑢|𝑣 denote the random variable found by conditioning 𝑢 on a specific realization of random variable 𝑣. Thus 𝑢|𝑣 has probability density function P(𝑢|𝑣); and we write P(𝑢) and P(𝑣) for the marginal probability densities on 𝑢 and 𝑣, respectively. If two random variables are independent then we write 𝑢 ⊥ ⊥ 𝑣.</p><p>We let 𝒫(R 𝑑 ) denote the space of all probability measures over R 𝑑 ; we simply write 𝒫 if the Euclidean space R 𝑑 is clear. Given 𝑓 : R 𝑑 ↦ → R we denote by</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">E 𝜌 [𝑓 ] = ∫︁ R 𝑑 𝑓 (𝑢)𝜌(𝑢) 𝑑𝑢</formula><p>the expectation of 𝑓 with respect to probability density function 𝜌 on R 𝑑 . On occasion, we also denote this expectation by 𝜌(𝑓 ).</p><p>We write 𝒩 (︀</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>𝑚, Σ</head><p>)︀ for the distribution of a Gaussian random variable on R 𝑑 with mean 𝑚 and covariance Σ. If we want to denote the probability density function of this random variable, expressed in terms of dummy variable 𝑢, we write 𝒩 (︀ 𝑢; 𝑚, Σ )︀ .</p><p>• Calculus Given function 𝑓 : R 𝑑 → R we denote by 𝐷𝑓 : R 𝑑 → R 𝑑 the gradient and by 𝐷 2 𝑓 : R 𝑑 → R 𝑑×𝑑 the Hessian. For more general functions 𝑓 : 𝒱 → R acting on elements 𝑣 of vector space 𝒱 we write 𝐷𝑓 to denote the derivative. We also directly consider functions 𝑓 : R 𝑑 → R 𝑑 with Jacobian matrix 𝐷𝑓 : R 𝑑 → R 𝑑×𝑑 . When there are two potentially varying arguments and we wish to indicate differentiation with respect to only one of them, say 𝑣, we will indicate this with a subscript: 𝐷 𝑣 (and similarly for second derivatives). When we contract a derivative to obtain divergence we write div : for example, for 𝑓 : R 𝑑 → R, Tr 𝐷𝑓 = div 𝑓. We use 𝑓 ∘ 𝑔 to indicate the composition of 𝑓 and 𝑔, assuming input dimensions (of 𝑓 ) and output dimensions (of 𝑔) are compatible, allowing composition. Finally if 𝐴 ⊂ R 𝑑 then we define the indicator function 1 𝐴 : R 𝑑 → R + by 1 𝐴 (𝑥) = 1 for 𝑥 ∈ 𝐴 and 1 𝐴 (𝑥) = 0 otherwise.</p><p>support of DOE and NSF (US) and the BBVA Foundation (Spain).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chapter 1 Bayesian Inversion</head><p>A forward model 𝐺 : R 𝑑 → R 𝑘 specifies output 𝑦 ∈ R 𝑘 from input 𝑢 ∈ R 𝑑 by the relationship 𝑦 = 𝐺(𝑢). The related inverse problem is to recover unknown parameter 𝑢 ∈ R 𝑑 from data, or observation, 𝑦 ∈ R 𝑘 defined by 𝑦 = 𝐺(𝑢) + 𝜂;</p><p>(1.1)</p><p>here 𝜂 ∈ R 𝑘 denotes observation noise. In the Bayesian approach to the inverse problem we view (𝑢, 𝑦) as jointly varying random variables and the solution of the inverse problem is the posterior distribution on parameter 𝑢, given a specific instance of the data 𝑦, found by conditioning the joint distribution. Implicit in this framing of the inverse problem is that, although 𝜂 is unknown, its distribution is known.</p><p>In Section 1.1 we formulate Bayesian inverse problems and state Bayes Theorem, giving an explicit expression for the posterior probability density function. In Section 1.2 we discuss finite dimensional summaries of the posterior and we connect Bayesian inversion to the classical optimization-based approach to inverse problems. Section 1.3 describes the well-posedness of the Bayesian formulation, using the Hellinger distance from Chapter 11. In Section 1.4 we discuss various perspectives on model error. Section 1.5 studies the use of machine-learned surrogate models. We conclude the chapter in Section 1.6, containing bibliographical remarks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Bayesian Inversion</head><p>We view (𝑢, 𝑦) ∈ R 𝑑 × R 𝑘 as a random variable, whose joint distribution is specified by means of the identity (1.1) and the following assumption on the distribution of (𝑢, 𝜂) ∈ R 𝑑 × R 𝑘 : Assumption 1.1. The distribution of the random variable (𝑢, 𝜂) ∈ R 𝑑 × R 𝑘 is defined by assuming that 𝑢 ⊥ ⊥ 𝜂, that 𝑢 ∼ 𝜌 and that 𝜂 ∼ 𝜈, where 𝜌 and 𝜈 are given probability density functions.</p><p>We make the following assumption about the provenance of the data: Data Assumption 1.2. Data 𝑦 ∈ R 𝑘 is given and is assumed to have come from a realization of the random variable (𝑢, 𝜂), under Assumption 1.1, and identity <ref type="bibr">(1.1)</ref>.</p><p>Combining these assumptions we can define the Bayesian inverse problem, a specific and important subclass of general Bayesian inference. We refer to 𝜌, the probability density function of 𝑢, as the prior probability density function. Given identity (1.1), then for fixed 𝑢 ∈ R 𝑑 , the distribution of 𝑦 given 𝑢 defines the likelihood:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">𝑦|𝑢 ∼ l(𝑦|𝑢) := 𝜈 (︀ 𝑦 -𝐺(𝑢) )︀</formula><p>.</p><p>(1.</p><p>2)</p><p>The posterior probability density function is the conditional distribution of 𝑢 given 𝑦, that is the distribution of random variable 𝑢|𝑦. The posterior density is the solution to the Bayesian formulation of the inverse problem. The primary computational challenge associated with Bayesian inversion is that it is an infinite dimensional problem. In particular it is important to appreciate that, although Bayes Theorem (which follows) delivers a formula for the probability density function of 𝑢|𝑦, the task of obtaining information from this probability density function, for example by drawing many samples from it, is, in general, a substantial challenge. </p></div>

Recall from the Preface that we denote by P(•) the probability density function of a random variable; and we denote by P(•|•) the probability density function conditional on the second argument. The standard laws of conditional probability give the two identities P(𝑢, 𝑦) = P(𝑢|𝑦) P(𝑦), if P(𝑦) &gt; 0, P(𝑢, 𝑦) = P(𝑦|𝑢) P(𝑢), if P(𝑢) &gt; 0.</p><p>The marginal probability density function on 𝑦 is given by P(𝑦) = </p></div>

We write the density of the joint distribution of (𝑦, 𝑢) ∈ R 𝑘 × R 𝑑 as 𝛾(𝑦, 𝑢).</p><p>We write the marginal density on 𝑦 ∈ R 𝑘 as 𝜅(𝑦). Note that 𝜅(𝑦) = 𝑍. ♢ Remark 1.5. If 𝐺 is linear and (𝑢, 𝜂) is Gaussian then the posterior on 𝑢|𝑦 is Gaussian. This Gaussian setting provides an explicitly solvable inverse problem in which the posterior is characterized by its mean and covariance; it reduces the infinite dimensional problem to a finite dimensional problem for a vector (mean) in R 𝑑 and a positive definite matrix (covariance) in R 𝑑×𝑑 .</p><p>To see this explicitly, let 𝐺(𝑢) = 𝐴𝑢 for matrix 𝐴 ∈ R 𝑘×𝑑 , and assume that 𝑢 ∼ 𝒩 (0, ̂︀ 𝐶) and 𝜂 ∼ 𝒩 (0, Γ) for positive definite covariance matrices ̂︀ 𝐶 and Γ.

We have concentrated on formulating Bayes Theorem around equation <ref type="bibr">(1.1)</ref> in which the noise appears additively and is independent of the unknown 𝑢. However Bayes Theorem is not restricted to this setting. Section 13.1 provides an explicit example, going beyond this additive noise setting, to formulate density estimation in a Bayesian fashion. ♢</p><p>We conclude by discussing the following modification of Data Assumption 1.2:</p><p>Data Assumption 1.7. Assume that 𝑢 true ∈ R 𝑑 is a deterministic true unknown parameter and that 𝑦 ∈ R 𝑘 is given by 𝑦 = 𝐺(𝑢 true ) + 𝜂, <ref type="bibr">(1.5)</ref> where 𝜂 is an unknown realization drawn from given centred noise probability density function 𝜈.</p><p>Remark 1.8. This assumption is useful for two primary reasons. The first is as the basis for analysis of Bayesian methods from the frequentist perspective; for instance, it can be important to understand whether the posterior distribution concentrates around true parameter 𝑢 true if the variance of the noise 𝜂 is small or if the volume of data is high, and then to quantify the concentration rate. A second use of the assumption in the Bayesian context is when studying model misspecification; in particular it can be useful when the data 𝑦 is derived from a true unknown 𝑢 true ∈ R 𝑑 that could not have been drawn from the prior 𝜌. ♢</p></div>

It is often useful, however, to extract finite dimensional information from the posterior distribution, in order to summarize aspects of the distribution. Remark 1.5 identifies a specific situation where a finite dimensional summary, comprising the posterior mean and covariance, fully characterizes the posterior, since the posterior is Gaussian. In general, however, we must seek finite dimensional summaries that will not fully characterize the posterior.

In applications such as imaging, the MAP estimator often provides sharper reconstructions than the posterior mean estimator; however, the latter has the advantage of being more stable to perturbations in the model, as will be explained in Section 1.3 below. ♢ Letting 𝑓 : R 𝑑 → R be the indicator function of a set 𝐴 ⊂ R 𝑑 , so that 𝑓 (𝑢) = 1 𝐴 (𝑢), we obtain the posterior probability of 𝐴 E 𝜋 𝑦 [1 𝐴 (𝑢)] = P 𝜋 𝑦 (𝐴).

If the Bayesian approach is adopted and MCMC (see <ref type="bibr">Section 15.5</ref>) is used to sample the posterior, generating each new sample typically requires evaluating the likelihood, and hence the forward model 𝐺.

When 𝐺 is computationally expensive to evaluate, the multiple evaluations of 𝐺 may be prohibitively expensive. We address this issue by using a cheap computational surrogate 𝐺 𝛿 . While optimization algorithms for MAP estimation often require much fewer forward model evaluations for convergence than MCMC sampling algorithms, surrogate models can also be helpful in classical optimization-based approaches to inverse problems. For instance, surrogate models can facilitate the use of gradient-based optimization algorithms (see <ref type="bibr">Chapter 15)</ref> in applications where gradients of 𝐺 are not available but gradients of the surrogate model 𝐺 𝛿 can easily be computed.</p><p>The methods described in Chapter 12 can be used to approximate the (scalar-valued) likelihood l resulting from 𝐺, by an approximation l 𝛿 with small error 𝛿, uniformly over bounded open 𝐷 ⊂ R 𝑑 . In Chapter 12 we focus on learning functions taking values in R; however all such methods can be generalized to approximate vector-valued 𝐺. This leads to uniform approximation over 𝐷 ⊂ R 𝑑 of 𝐺 by 𝐺 𝛿 , which in turn results in a uniform approximation l 𝛿 of the likelihood l.</p><p>Such an approximation 𝐺 𝛿 can be learned under the setting of Data Assumption 1.23. If carefully designed, the machine learning approximation of the likelihood will be much faster to evaluate than the true likelihood and, because of the approximation properties, will result in accurate posterior inference, with errors of size 𝛿. Such results rely on error bounds of the form given in Section 12.5 which (with high probability) can be obtained with a number 𝑁 of evaluations of the forward model which is often orders of magnitude smaller than the number of evaluations required within MCMC, or even MAP estimation in the context of learning model error (see Subsection 1.5.3 below). The resulting method can thus be very efficient. The next subsection describes underpinning theory to transfer approximation of the forward model to approximation of the posterior.</p></div>

Even when MAP estimation is used, multiple evaluations of 𝐺 may be needed to optimize the objective function. Furthermore, if model error is being jointly learned, in the setting of Subsection 1.4.3, then multiple MAP estimators may be required leading to many more evaluations. This subsection is centered on surrogate modelling for MAP estimation when model error is also being learned.</p><p>Recall the Bayesian inverse problem to jointly estimate unknown parameter 𝑢 and unknown model error parameter 𝛼 defined in <ref type="bibr">(1.21)</ref>. Thus we have access to a family of computational models 𝐺 c (• ; 𝛼) : R 𝑑 → R 𝑘 parameterized by 𝛼 ∈ R 𝑝 . Our data assumption is as follows:</p><p>Data Assumption 1.28. Data is available in the form {︁ 𝑢 (𝑛) , 𝛼 (𝑛) , 𝑦 (𝑛)   }︁ 𝑁 𝑛=1 , <ref type="bibr">(1.25)</ref> where the {𝑢 (𝑛) , 𝛼 (𝑛) } 𝑁 𝑛=1 are generated i.i.d. from probability density function ϒ ⊗ 𝑞 ∈ 𝒫(𝐷 × R 𝑝 ), for some 𝐷 ⊆ R 𝑑 , and where 𝑦 (𝑛) = 𝐺 c (𝑢 (𝑛) , 𝛼 (𝑛) ).</p><p>From this data we may learn a cheap surrogate for 𝐺 c , using the techniques of Chapter 12. The MAP estimation problem, in the context of Subsection 1.4.3, requires minimization, over the pair (𝑢, 𝛼), of</p><formula xml:id="formula_39">J(𝑢, 𝛼) = -log 𝜈 (︀ 𝑦 -𝐺 c (𝑢, 𝛼) )︀ -log 𝜌(𝑢, 𝛼).</formula><p>Some methods for this problem work by alternating minimization over 𝑢 and over 𝛼; a prototypical such method is to iterate, for ℓ until convergence, starting from initial 𝛼 0 ∈ R 𝑝 :</p><formula xml:id="formula_40">𝑢 ℓ+1 ∈ arg min 𝑢∈R 𝑑 J (︀ 𝑢, 𝛼 ℓ )︀ , (1.26a) 𝛼 ℓ+1 ∈ arg min 𝛼∈R 𝑝 J (︀ 𝑢 ℓ+1 , 𝛼 )︀ . (1.26b)</formula><p>Generalizations of this alternating strategy are possible; for example a finite number of steps (possibly ℓ-dependent) of gradient descent may be substituted for the two minimizations. For each ℓ, multiple evaluations of 𝐺 c (•, •) may be required and use of a surrogate may make the method more efficient. Finally, we point out that similar ideas to accelerate Bayesian inversion in the presence of model error apply when computing posterior summaries via sampling rather than a MAP estimator via optimization. For sampling the joint posterior distribution over the pair (𝑢, 𝛼), a natural approach is given by the Gibbs sampler from Subsection 15.5.2. As in <ref type="bibr">(1.26)</ref>, the Gibbs sampler would then alternate between sampling the conditional of 𝑢 given 𝛼 and the conditional of 𝛼 given 𝑢. Such a Gibbs sampler would also directly benefit from use of cheap surrogate 𝐺 c .</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chapter 2 Variational Inference</head><p>A problem has a variational formulation if its solution can be written as the minimizer of an objective function. The variational formulation of any problem in mathematics is useful because it opens the door to computational methods. Such computational methods seek to minimize the objective function over a strict subset of the whole space over which the original variational problem is posed. If the strict subset is chosen judiciously (this is a problem-dependent choice) then the resulting computational methodology is both tractable and yields a useful, and interpretable, approximation of the solution of the original variational problem posed on the whole space.</p><p>This chapter is devoted to formulating Bayes Theorem 1.3 variationally and using this formulation as the basis for approximate inference. We continue to work under Data Assumption 1.2. Under this data assumption, and given a prior distribution on 𝑢, the posterior distribution on 𝑢|𝑦 is defined by Bayes Theorem 1.3. In Section 2.1 we show how this theorem can be formulated variationally as a minimization problem over the set of all probability density functions. This leads to the core methodology of variational inference, and in Section 2.2 we present two canonical choices of subsets of all probability density functions over which to approximate the posterior: the mean-field and Gaussian subsets. In Section 2.3 we discuss some key properties of variational inference, studying other choices of optimization problem which yield the posterior as a minimizer, and linking to the evidence lower bound. We conclude the chapter, in Section 2.4, with bibliographical remarks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Variational Formulation Of Bayes Theorem</head><p>Our starting point in this section is Bayes Theorem 1.3. Because 𝑦 dependence is not central to our discussions here we write the posterior as 𝜋 := 𝜋 𝑦 . A useful formulation of Bayes Theorem arises from seeking the posterior as the solution of an optimization problem over the space of probability density functions. In what follows we recall from the Preface that 𝒫 := 𝒫(R 𝑑 ) denotes the space of all probability density functions over R 𝑑 . The objective F : 𝒫 → R of the optimization problem measures the discrepancy between the posterior density 𝜋 and a candidate density 𝑞; the objective is constructed to be minimized at 𝑞 = 𝜋. By using Bayes Theorem 1.3 the objective function can be rewritten in terms of the prior, the likelihood and the normalization constant.</p><p>One natural class of objective functions F is defined by the class of f-divergences D f (𝑞‖𝜋) :</p><formula xml:id="formula_41">F(𝑞) := D f (𝑞‖𝜋) = ∫︁ f (︂ 𝑞(𝑢) 𝜋(𝑢) )︂</formula></div>

By the properties of all divergences, detailed at the start of Section 11.2, we deduce that F(𝑞) is minimized at 𝑞 = 𝜋 and that this is the unique minimizer. A particularly useful choice arises from setting f(𝑡) = 𝑡 log(𝑡), leading to definition of the objective</p><formula xml:id="formula_42">F(𝑞) := D KL (𝑞‖𝜋) = ∫︁ log (︂ 𝑞(𝑢) 𝜋(𝑢) )︂ 𝑞(𝑢) 𝑑𝑢, (<label>2</label></formula><p>.1) the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. This choice of objective is convenient because F(•) can be minimized without knowledge of the normalization constant of 𝜋, thus sharing a key property with Metropolis-Hastings MCMC methods -see Remark 15.21. For proof of this property of the minimization of F(•) see the proof of Theorem 2.1 and Remark 11.36. Because of this desirable property, we work almost exclusively with KL divergence (2.1) to define variational formulations of Bayes Theorem 1.3. However, in Subsection 2.3.1, we discuss reversing the order of 𝑞 and 𝜋 in the arguments of the KL divergence. Using the KL divergence (2.1) to formulate variational inference delivers the following theorem: Theorem 2.1. Consider the Bayesian inverse problem defined by prior 𝜌 and likelihood l given by (1.2), under Data Assumption 1.2.

Furthermore the first term in <ref type="bibr">(2.4)</ref> is the expectation of the first term in <ref type="bibr">(1.8)</ref>.

In the next subsection we work in a different subset 𝒬, the set of Gaussian measures, in which it is possible to approximate correlation information. ♢</p></div>

In many applications, interest is focused on ultimately estimating the first two moments of 𝜋; in this context a natural family to consider is Gaussian distributions. In this subsection we derive optimality conditions for the solution to the resulting optimization problem. To find a Gaussian approximation, we seek to minimize D KL (•‖𝜋) over the set of distributions</p><formula xml:id="formula_53">𝒬 := {︀ 𝑞 ∈ 𝒫 : 𝑞 = 𝒩 (𝑚, Σ), (𝑚, Σ) ∈ 𝒞 }︀ , (<label>2.7a</label></formula><p>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_54">𝒞 := {︀ 𝑚 ∈ R 𝑑 , Σ ∈ R 𝑑×𝑑 sym,≥ }︀ .</formula><p>(2.7b) Proposition 2.7.

Since D KL (𝑞‖𝜋) = ∫︁ log 𝑞(𝑢) 𝑞(𝑢) 𝑑𝑢 -∫︁ log 𝜋(𝑢) 𝑞(𝑢) 𝑑𝑢, the desired result follows. Remark 2.8. The two terms in the objective function (2.8) can be interpreted as having a competitive behavior and as regularizing the MAP perspective. The first term is maximized by a Gaussian distribution with zero variance, centered at the MAP estimator of 𝜋, the point of highest posterior density: a Dirac measure at the posterior mode. The second term, however, approaches positive infinity if the variance of any marginal approaches zero. Hence, the second term in the objective regularizes the optimization problem to ensure the approximating Gaussian is not degenerate in any direction. ♢ Proposition 2.9.

Using the reverse KL divergence as an objective is computationally convenient in the setting where we can evaluate the likelihood and the prior, but we do not necessarily know the normalization constant, nor do we necessarily have the ability to easily sample from the posterior. In comparison, the forward KL divergence</p><formula xml:id="formula_63">𝑞 ↦ → D KL (𝜋‖𝑞) = E 𝜋 [log(𝜋/𝑞)]</formula><p>is more convenient for optimization over 𝒬 when we can sample from 𝜋, but do not necessarily have access to an analytical expression for the target density.</p><p>In addition to computational considerations, the two choices of KL divergence lead to different behavior when minimizing over a subset of probability measures. The reverse KL favors approximate distributions where log(𝑞/𝜋) is small in regions of high probability of 𝑞, that is when 𝑞 ≈ 𝜋 where 𝑞 is large, or in regions where 𝑞 is much smaller than 𝜋. As a result, the minimizers for 𝑞 tend to fit one mode of multi-modal distributions 𝜋, but miss the other modes. Hence, minimizing the reverse KL is also known as mode-seeking. In contrast, the minimizers of the forward KL favor approximate distributions 𝑞 where log(𝜋/𝑞) is small in regions of high probability of 𝜋. This occurs by having 𝑞 be non-zero everywhere in the support of 𝜋 so the denominator in the log does not approach zero. Placing mass everywhere in the support of 𝜋 leads to a mean-seeking behavior, where the minimizer for 𝑞 corresponds to matching the moments of the target density 𝜋.</p><p>The following remark shows that mean-seeking behavior is apparent when the set 𝒬 comprises Gaussians. The remark also introduces a useful definition for a form of Gaussian projection from the space of all probability measures on R 𝑑 onto the space of Gaussians on R 𝑑 .</p><p>Remark 2.11. We write 𝒢 = 𝒢(R 𝑑 ) for the set of all probability density functions over R 𝑑 , including degenerate Gaussians with non-invertible covariance; in particular all Dirac measures are contained in 𝒢.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2">Evidence Lower Bound</head><p>We now relate J(𝑞), defined by (2.2a), to an important concept in variational inference:, namely the evidence lower bound (ELBO) given in Definition 15.15:</p><formula xml:id="formula_66">ELBO(̃︀ 𝜋, 𝑞) = E 𝑞 [log ̃︀ 𝜋(𝑢)] -E 𝑞 [log 𝑞(𝑢)].</formula><p>The reason for the terminology evidence lower bound will be made clear through Remarks 2.13, 2.14. The evidence lower bound is sometimes also known as the negative variational free energy. The definition is often used in the situation where ̃︀ 𝜋(𝑢) is found from the joint distribution of random variable (𝑢, 𝑦), with 𝑦 frozen. This is the setting of the following proposition, which sheds first light on the significance of the ELBO functional. Recall prior measure 𝜌(𝑢), likelihood function l(𝑦|𝑢) given by equation (1.2) and posterior measure 𝜋 := 𝜋 𝑦 given by Theorem 1.3. Proof. This follows from noting that</p><formula xml:id="formula_67">ELBO(̃︀ 𝜋, 𝑞) = E 𝑞 [log 𝜋(𝑢)] -E 𝑞 [log 𝑞(𝑢)] + E 𝑞 [log ̃︀ 𝜋(𝑢)] -E 𝑞 [log 𝜋(𝑢)] = E 𝑞 [log 𝜋(𝑢)] -E 𝑞 [log 𝑞(𝑢)] + E 𝑞 [log(𝑍)] = -D KL (𝑞‖𝜋) + log(𝑍).</formula><p>Since 𝑍 is independent of 𝑞, optimality requires that D KL (𝑞 opt ‖𝜋) = 0, and hence that 𝑞 opt = 𝜋. As a consequence ELBO(̃︀ 𝜋, 𝑞 opt ) = log(𝑍).</p><p>Remark 2.13. In the preceding proposition ̃︀ 𝜋(𝑢) = P(𝑢, 𝑦) is the joint distribution and the normalizing constant 𝑍 = P(𝑦) is called the evidence. Thus the preceding proposition demonstrates the significance of the quantity ELBO(𝜋, 𝑞 opt ): it delivers the logarithm of the evidence, namely the log-probability that the observed data 𝑦 was produced by the statistical model for the joint random variable (𝑢, 𝑦) defined by equation (</p><p>1.1) and Assumption 1.1. It is natural to ask what we can learn about the evidence if we perform variational inference over subset 𝒬 of 𝒫; this is the subject of the next remark. ♢ Remark 2.14. Variational inference is performed by solving the following optimization problem over 𝒬 ⊂ 𝒫 : 𝑞 ⋆ ∈ arg min 𝑞∈𝒬 J(𝑞).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chapter 3 Learning The Prior</head><p>In Bayesian inference the prior acts as a form of regularization. This can be seen explicitly for both the optimization and probabilistic approaches to inverse problems. First, consider the optimization approach and MAP estimation as described in Subsection 1.2.1. In that setting the objective function is a sum of two terms: the loss function, which is a data mismatch term; and a regularizer, given by the negative logarithm of the prior 𝜌. Secondly, consider the probabilistic approach, and the variational form of Bayes Theorem as described in Subsection 2.1, and Remark 2.2, in particular. The posterior is shown to be the minimizer of an objective defined over probability densities. This objective is the sum of two terms: the data mismatch term, which is the expectation, with respect to the putative minimizer 𝑞, of the loss function; and the regularizer, which is the KL divergence between the putative minimizer 𝑞 and the prior 𝜌.</p><p>Defining a prior, or regularizer, can be challenging. Often modellers make simple parametric choices, based on domain specific knowledge or intuition, within some class of priors or regularizers. For example if a Gaussian prior is adopted then the mean and covariance is selected using domain knowledge. However the abundance of data that is available in many fields suggests the possibility of employing purely data-driven priors for inversion, a major focus of this chapter.</p><p>We start, in Section 3.1, by discussing Bayesian Hierarchical modelling, learning parameters of the prior simply employing the Data Assumption 1.2 used to define the inverse problem. Then, in Section 3.2, we introduce Data Assumption 3.2, when multiple samples from the prior are available. We discuss learning the prior measure from data {𝑢 (𝑛) } 𝑁 𝑛=1 drawn from the prior, relating this problem to the unsupervised learning task studied in Chapter 13. In Section 3.3 we consider this setting, representing the prior via a pushforward; such an approach arises when the prior is learned from data as a transport or using autoencoders. Section 3.4 contains a theoretical analysis of the effect of errors in the prior on errors in the posterior. Section 3.5 contains concluding bibliographic remarks. When learning parameterized priors and regularizers, the optimal parameter typically depends on the observed data 𝑦. In Chapter 5 we will study how to learn this dependence from data {(𝑢 (𝑛) , 𝑦 (𝑛) } 𝑁 𝑛=1 drawn from the joint distribution of (𝑢, 𝑦) ∈ R 𝑑 × R 𝑘 determined by the product of prior and likelihood.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Bayesian Hierarchical Modelling</head><p>Recall the Bayesian inverse problem of finding 𝑢 ∈ R 𝑑 from 𝑦 ∈ R 𝑘 when related by (1.1), so that 𝑦 = 𝐺(𝑢) + 𝜂.</p><p>The Bayesian hierarchical methodology postulates a parameterized family of priors, 𝜌(𝑢; 𝜃) and proposes to learn the pair (𝑢, 𝜃) from the single piece of data 𝑦 given by Data Assumption 1.2. Thus, we learn both the unknown and parameters that define the prior, from 𝑦. To formulate this problem we view the parameterized family of priors 𝜌(𝑢; 𝜃) as conditional probability densities 𝜌(𝑢|𝜃), put a prior 𝜌(𝜃) on parameter 𝜃 and construct the prior 𝜌(𝑢, 𝜃) = 𝜌(𝑢|𝜃)𝜌(𝜃) on the pair (𝑢, 𝜃). Under appropriate generalization of the assumptions of Theorem 1.3 to the jointly varying pair (𝑢, 𝜃), the posterior distribution in this case is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_72">𝜋(𝑢, 𝜃) = 1 𝑍 𝜈 (︀ 𝑦 -𝐺(𝑢) )︀ 𝜌(𝑢, 𝜃); (3.1)</formula><p>we have dropped the explicit dependence of the posterior on 𝑦 for notational convenience. and 𝜂 ∼ 𝒩 (0, 1). We place a prior on 𝑢|𝜃 with form 𝒩 (𝜃, 1); if we then assume 𝜃 ∼ 𝒩 (0, 1) then this specifies a jointly Gaussian prior 𝜌(𝑢, 𝜃) on the pair (𝑢, 𝜃). Under the specified prior 𝜌(𝑢, 𝜃), 𝑢 = 𝜃 + 𝜉 𝑢 and 𝜃 = 𝜉 𝜃 where 𝜉 𝑢 and 𝜉 𝜃 are independent unit Gaussians. Thus, under this prior, 𝑢 = 𝜉 𝑢 + 𝜉 𝜃 and hence has distribution given by 𝜌(𝑢) := 𝒩 (𝑢; 0, 2).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>𝜌(𝑢).</head><p>In general it is not possible to integrate out the parameter 𝜃; the specific structure on 𝜌(𝑢, 𝜃) allows it in this case. ♢ Hierarchical Bayesian learning works with the same Data Assumption 1.2 that we employ to define the standard Bayesian inverse problem defined by <ref type="bibr">(1.1)</ref>. Each different data instance for 𝑦 would give rise to a different choice of the parameter 𝜃, or distribution over the parameter 𝜃, entering the prior for 𝑢. Hence we obtain a different prior on 𝑢 for each data instance 𝑦. In the next subsection, and indeed in the remainder of this chapter, we work in a different scenario where the form of the prior is learned from samples of that prior; we hence have a different data assumption.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Learning The Prior</head><p>In this section we describe the idea of learning a prior on 𝑢 from data derived by sampling 𝑢, from the prior, many times. We make the following data assumption to enable this: Data Assumption 3.2. We are given samples {𝑢 (𝑛) } 𝑁 𝑛=1 assumed to be drawn i.i.d. from prior measure 𝜌 on 𝑢 which is unknown.</p><p>This immediately yields an empirical approximation for 𝜌 :</p><formula xml:id="formula_76">𝜌 𝑁 (𝑢) = 1 𝑁 𝑁 ∑︁ 𝑛=1 𝛿(𝑢 -𝑢 (𝑛) ). (3.2)</formula><p>Once a smooth prior is learned from this empirical approximation, it can be re-used for different inverse problems for 𝑢, or for different instances of the realization 𝑦 used in that inverse problem. To clearly understand the methodology of this section it is important to distinguish between the piece of data, 𝑦, for which we wish to solve the inverse problem defined by (1.1), and the training data {𝑢 (𝑛) } 𝑁 𝑛=1 which we assume are available to us, and which we use to learn about the prior. Now compare Data Assumption 3.2 to Data Assumption 13.1 in Chapter 13. The latter assumption arises in unsupervised learning; notice that, taking ϒ := 𝜌 shows that the two assumptions are identical. Thus, when the prior is only given to us through Data Assumption 3.2, we may seek to approximate it using the generative modelling techniques of Chapter 13.</p></div>

The significance of Proposition 3.3 is that it implies that we can solve the Bayesian inverse problem (3.4), posed in the latent space, and push forward under 𝑔 to find solutions of the original Bayesian inverse problem defined by (3.3). For example if we generate samples under 𝜋 𝑔 in the latent space, then application of 𝑔 to those samples will generate samples under 𝜋 in the original space. Hence, if pair (𝑔, 𝜁) are known, then the original Bayesian inverse problem for 𝜋 on R 𝑑 may be converted to one for 𝜋 𝑔 on R 𝑑𝑧 ; pushforward of 𝜋 𝑔 under 𝑔 yields solution to the original problem. A similar expression to (3.4) may be established even if 𝑑 𝑧 &lt; 𝑑, but it no longer follows that 𝜋 = 𝑔 ♯ 𝜋 𝑔 because 𝑔 is not invertible. ♢ Proof of Proposition 3.3.

In Subsections 3.4.1 and 3.4.2 we prove two theorems which address this effect. In Theorem 3.6 we assume that the approximation of the exact transport map leads to an approximate smooth prior, in the space of 𝑢, and look at the effect on the posterior of the approximation error between this prior and the true prior.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chapter 4 Transport To The Posterior</head><p>In this chapter we formulate various transport approaches to determining the posterior distribution, building on the material relating to transport in Chapter 13. In Section 4.1 we discuss mapping the prior to the posterior, setting it up as an optimization problem over a parametrized class of transports. In Section 4.2 we obtain insights on this problem by considering a non-parametric formulation. Section 4.3 sets this work in the context of variational inference. In Section 4.4 we generalize the transport approach: we consider maps from general latent spaces, not restricted to the prior, to the posterior. Section 4.5 is devoted to using transport to enhance MCMC. Bibliographic remarks are contained in Section 4.6.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Insight From Nonparametric Formulation</head><p>The terms in objective (4.3) are competitive. To understand this, first consider minimizing an objective function defined by the first two terms alone. This is achieved by setting 𝑇 (𝑢; 𝜃) = 𝑢 MAP , given by (1.9), for all 𝑢 ∈ R 𝑑 : thus the resulting posterior approximation, found by pushing forward the prior under 𝑇 (𝑢; 𝜃), is simply a Dirac measure at the MAP point of the posterior density. On the other hand, including the third and last term ensures that the determinant of the Jacobian of the map is strictly positive: det 𝐷 𝑢 𝑇 (𝑢; 𝜃) &gt; 0 for all 𝑢 ∈ R 𝑑 . For a continuously differentiable map with positive Jacobian determinant at each input 𝑢 ∈ R 𝑑 , the inverse function theorem then establishes that the map is locally invertible at 𝑢. This rules out a map, such as 𝑇 (𝑢; 𝜃) = 𝑢 MAP , which is not invertible. The optimal solution determined by (4.3) thus defines an invertible map whose pushforward takes the prior to the posterior; it may be thought of as a regularization of the map that simply takes the prior to a Dirac measure centered at the MAP point.</p><p>The following gives insight into the learning problem for the transport map 𝑇 if the posterior density is log-concave, by considering minimization of a functional over an infinite class of transports. First we define convex optimization problems. To understand the following definition, recall the definitions for a convex function (Definition 15.1) and a convex set (Definition 15.2).</p><p>Definition 4.3. Let J : 𝒯 → R be a functional defined on a subset 𝒯 of a vector space. The optimization problem min 𝑇 ∈𝒯 J(𝑇 ) is convex if 𝒯 is a convex set and if J is convex: J(𝜆𝑇 1 +(1-𝜆)𝑇 2 ) ≤ 𝜆J(𝑇 1 )+(1-𝜆)J(𝑇 2 ) for all 𝑇 1 , 𝑇 2 ∈ 𝒯 and 𝜆 ∈ [0, 1]. ♢ Theorem 4.4.

Define the space of diffeomorphic maps</p><formula xml:id="formula_99">𝒯 = {︁ 𝑇 ∈ 𝐶 1 (R 𝑑 ; R 𝑑 ), det 𝐷 𝑢 𝑇 (𝑢) &gt; 0 for all 𝑢 ∈ R 𝑑 }︁ .</formula><p>Then the optimization problem</p><formula xml:id="formula_100">arg min 𝑇 ∈𝒯 -E 𝑢∼𝜌 [︁ log 𝜌 ∘ 𝑇 (𝑢) + log l ∘ 𝑇 (𝑢) + log det 𝐷 𝑢 𝑇 (𝑢) ]︁ is (strictly) convex.

Then minimizing a convex functional over a convex set yields the result.</p><p>Remark 4.5. This theorem demonstrates that, if the posterior is log-concave, then parameterization of 𝜃 ↦ → 𝑇 (𝑢; 𝜃) restricted to 𝒯 will lead to a desirable objective function for the purpose of optimization. In particular, the minimizer will be unique for a strictly convex problem, provided it exists. However, we note that if the map parameterization 𝜃 ↦ → 𝑇 (𝑢; 𝜃) is not convex for all 𝑢 ∈ R 𝑑 , then the optimization problem of minimizing (4.3) over the parameters 𝜃 is in general non-convex even if 𝜋 is log-concave. See the related discussion in Remark 12.7 concerning supervised learning. ♢ Remark 4.6. In general, it is not the case that the nonparametric optimization of J(•) over 𝒯 will have a minimizer; if 𝒯 is an open set the minimizing sequences may not have a limit in 𝒯 . In practice, compactness can be enforced on the optimization by adding a penalty, such as an RKHS norm, or by imposing a constraint on the parameters of the map to compactify the optimization problem. ♢</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Connection To Variational Inference</head><p>In this section we return to the parameterized optimization problem (4.2) and consider it from the perspective of variational inference. Motivated by the analysis in the previous section we consider the parametric class of maps</p><formula xml:id="formula_102">𝒯 := {︁ 𝑇 (•; 𝜃) ∈ 𝐶 1 (R 𝑑 ; R 𝑑 ), 𝜃 ∈ Θ ⃒ ⃒</formula><p>⃒det 𝐷 𝑢 𝑇 (𝑢; 𝜃) &gt; 0 for all (𝑢, 𝜃) ∈ R 𝑑 × Θ }︁ . Theorem 4.7. Assume that 𝑇 (• ; 𝜃) ∈ 𝒯 for all 𝜃 ∈ Θ. Let 𝜃 ⋆ be the optimal parameter solving (4.4), with J(•) defined by (4.3). Furthermore, let 𝒬 := {𝑞 : 𝑞 = 𝑇 ♯ 𝜌, 𝑇 ∈ 𝒯 }. If 𝑞 ⋆ := 𝑇 (•; 𝜃 ⋆ ) ♯ 𝜌 then this density solves the variational inference problem 𝑞 ⋆ ∈ arg min 𝑞∈𝒬 D KL (𝑞‖𝜋). Proof. We first note that the class 𝒯 necessarily comprises only invertible maps. We showed above that solving the optimization problem (4.4), with J(•) defined by (4.3), is equivalent to minimizing F(•) from (4.2). But from Theorem 11.41 we have that, for invertible and differentiable transformations, D KL (𝜌‖𝑇 -1 (•; 𝜃) ♯ 𝜋) = D KL (𝑇 (•; 𝜃) ♯ 𝜌‖𝜋). Thus, arg min 𝜃∈Θ J(𝜃) = arg min 𝜃∈Θ D KL (𝑇 (•; 𝜃) ♯ 𝜌‖𝜋). Lastly, 𝑇 (•; 𝜃 ⋆ ) : R 𝑑 → R 𝑑 is a differentiable map, and its derivative has positive determinant; it is therefore an invertible map. Thus 𝑇 (𝑢; 𝜃 ⋆ ) ♯ 𝜌 ∈ 𝒬. Example 4.8. Consider the setting where the prior is a standard Gaussian 𝒩 (0, 𝐼). Now assume that 𝑇 is affine: 𝑇 (𝑢) = 𝐴𝑢 + 𝑚, for an invertible matrix 𝐷 𝑢 𝑇 (𝑢) = 𝐴 ∈ R 𝑑×𝑑 and vector 𝑚 ∈ R 𝑑 . An affine transformation of a standard Gaussian yields a Gaussian random variable. In fact, the class of approximate posterior distributions then consists of multivariate Gaussians of the form 𝒬 = {︁ 𝑞 = 𝒩 (𝑚, 𝐴𝐴 ⊤ ), 𝑚 ∈ R 𝑑 , 𝐴 ∈ R 𝑑×𝑑 invertible }︁ . Hence, solving the optimization problem for J(•) is a subclass of the general Gaussian variational inference problem considered in Subsection 2.2.2. Here we are parameterizing the Gaussian covariance through a square root; for example it is possible to parameterize the covariance using its Cholesky factorization by considering triangular matrices 𝐴 ∈ R 𝑑×𝑑 in 𝒬 with positive diagonal entries. ♢ Example 4.9. Let 𝜌 be a probability density function in the mean-field family in Definition 2.3. Furthermore let 𝑇 be a diagonal map of the form 𝑇 (𝑢) = (︀ 𝑇 1 (𝑢 1 ), . . . , 𝑇 𝑑 (𝑢 𝑑 ) )︀ where 𝑇 𝑖 : R → R are univariate differentiable and invertible transformations: that is 𝐷 𝑢 𝑖 𝑇 𝑖 (𝑢 𝑖 ) &gt; 0 for all 𝑢 𝑖 ∈ R. Then, the class of approximate posterior distributions corresponds to 𝒬 = {︃ 𝑞(𝑢) = ∏︁ 𝑖 𝑞 𝑖 (𝑢 𝑖 ), 𝑞 𝑖 = (𝑇 𝑖 ) ♯ 𝜌 𝑖 }︃ . ♢</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Learning Other Maps To The Posterior</head><p>So far we looked for a map pushing forward the prior to the posterior. This is advantageous when we would like the posterior to inherit certain properties of the prior. For example, if the prior and posterior have the same tail behavior, then the transport map 𝑇 only needs to depart from an identity map in the bulk of the distribution. Similarly, if the posterior and prior only differ on a low-dimensional subspace of the parameters 𝑢 ∈ R 𝑑 , then the map 𝑇 can be represented using a ridge function that is constant for inputs orthogonal to the subspace of interest. Pushing forward from the prior can be advantageous because priors that are easily sampled are often deployed in practice.</p><p>However in some settings it may be computationally expedient to seek 𝜋 which is the pushforward of a different, easy-to-sample, reference density 𝜚(𝑢) on R 𝑑 , (such as a multivariate Gaussian) rather than the prior 𝜌(𝑢) (when it is not Gaussian). Choosing a different reference measure may thus be convenient when it is challenging to sample from the prior density or when the posterior is very different from the prior -for example having different tail behavior.</p><p>To consider this setting we replace (4.2) by</p><formula xml:id="formula_103">F(𝜃) = D KL (︀ 𝜚‖𝑇 -1 (•; 𝜃) ♯ 𝜋 )︀ .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chapter 5 Data Dependence Of The Posterior</head><p>This chapter presents methodologies for learning observation dependence in the regularizers, MAP estimators and transports that characterize the posterior distribution for Bayesian inverse problems. It is helpful to recall the notation, from Remark 1.4, for the probability density function 𝛾(𝑦, 𝑢) characterizing the joint distribution of random variable (𝑦, 𝑢) on observations and state, and the marginal 𝜅(𝑦) = ∫︀ 𝛾(𝑦, 𝑢) 𝑑𝑢 on the observations. The density may be factorized as 𝛾(𝑦, 𝑢) = l(𝑦|𝑢)𝜌(𝑢), formed from the product of the likelihood l(𝑦|𝑢), for the distribution on 𝑦|𝑢, and the prior density 𝜌(𝑢) on 𝑢. Our focus is on learning the dependence of the posterior distribution 𝜋 𝑦 (𝑢) on 𝑦; recall the posterior is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_106">𝜋 𝑦 (𝑢) = 1 𝑍 l(𝑦|𝑢)𝜌(𝑢),<label>(5.1a</label></formula><p>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_107">𝑍 = E 𝑢∼𝜌 [︀ l(𝑦|𝑢) ]︀</formula><p>.</p><p>(5.1b)</p><p>In this chapter, unlike the previous one, the dependence of the target measure on 𝑦 is important, and so we retain it explicitly in the notation 𝜋 𝑦 . Our goal here is to learn a map that explicitly depends on the observation 𝑦 and can be used to sample from, or otherwise characterize, the posterior distribution corresponding to any realization of 𝑦.</p><p>The resulting model can then be repeatedly used for different realizations, rather than having to re-learn a different map for each 𝑦. This reduces the cost of multiple inference procedures to training a single model. Hence" the approach is known as amortized inference or simply amortization.</p><p>We start with two subsections devoted to the learning of regularizers. We have already discussed learning the prior in Chapter 3, but there it was simply assumed that data samples from the prior were available. Here we work with different assumptions, involving both samples from the prior and from the marginal on observation 𝑦. We do this first in the context of MAP estimation, in Section 5.1; we then study the general Bayesian inversion setting in Section 5.2. It is natural that regularizers are learned to work successfully for multiple data realizations, to avoid over-fitting to a specific data realization. It is for this reason that learning regularizers is included in this chapter. In Section 5.1 we assume that we have access to samples from the joint distribution 𝛾. In Section 5.2 we assume that we have independent samples from the two marginals of 𝛾, 𝜅 and 𝜌, and that the likelihood l(𝑦|𝑢) can be evaluated during training.</p><p>In Section 5.3 we return to brief discussion of learning observation data dependence of MAP estimators, but do not specifically focus on learning a regularizer; furthermore we allow for randomness in the mapping from data to map estimator. In Section 5.4 we introduce transport approaches to amortized inference, returning to the setting were marginal samples from 𝛾 are available and where the likelihood l(𝑦|𝑢) can be evaluated during training. We introduce likelihood-free approaches in Section 5.5 -we assume that the likelihood cannot be evaluated, but it can be sampled. We again use transport maps and in that section we also discuss the consequence of having block-triangular pushforwards; and we discuss the learning of block-triangular transport maps, encoding data dependence in a natural way. Section 5.6 discusses the learning of likelihoods which is a natural extension of the ideas in the preceding subsection. We end with Section 5.7 containing bibliographic remarks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Learning Regularizers For MAP Estimation</head><p>Again recall the inverse problem of finding 𝑢 ∈ R 𝑑 from 𝑦 ∈ R 𝑘 when related by (1.1):</p><formula xml:id="formula_108">𝑦 = 𝐺(𝑢) + 𝜂.</formula><p>We describe the idea of bilevel optimization to determine parameter 𝜃 ∈ Θ ⊆ R 𝑝 defining a regularizer in MAP estimation. The data assumption here differs from that employed in Section 3.2. We now assume (see Remark 1.4): Data Assumption 5.1. We are given samples {𝑦 (𝑛) , 𝑢 (𝑛) } 𝑁 𝑛=1 assumed to be drawn i.i.d. from the joint probability measure 𝛾 on (𝑦, 𝑢) ∈ R 𝑘 × R 𝑑 defined by equation (1.1) and Assumption 1.1.</p><p>Such data is exactly what is required for the ideas of supervised learning from Chapter 12, where we use it to learn map from 𝑢 ∈ R 𝑑 to 𝑦 ∈ R; this is readily generalized to vector-valued output 𝑦. Note that, to solve the inverse problem, we would like to learn the inverse map from the data 𝑦 ∈ R 𝑘 to the state 𝑢 ∈ R 𝑑 . We could try and do this directly using supervised learning. However, for inverse problems in which 𝑘 &lt; 𝑑, learning such a map may be difficult because of a lack of uniqueness; furthermore there is noise present in the 𝑦 (𝑛) which needs to be carefully accounted for. For these reasons it is arguably more informative to learn, from the supervised data defined by Data Assumption 5.1, how to regularize the inverse problem. This is the viewpoint we take here.</p><p>To understand the proposed methodology clearly it is important to distinguish between the one piece of data 𝑦 for which we wish to solve the inverse problem defined by (1.1) and the training data pairs {𝑢 (𝑛) , 𝑦 (𝑛) } 𝑁 𝑛=1 (supervised data) which we assume are available to us, and which we use to learn the regularizer. This is different from Chapter 3 where we discussed learning the prior (and hence a regularizer for MAP estimation); in that chapter the training data from which we learn or define the prior was unsupervised data {𝑢 (𝑛) } 𝑁 𝑛=1 . We recall the posterior probability density function 𝜋 𝑦 (𝑢) on 𝑢|𝑦 from Theorem 1.3, but assume that prior 𝜌 depends on an unknown parameter 𝜃 ∈ Θ ⊆ R 𝑝 so that the posterior has form</p><formula xml:id="formula_109">𝜋 𝑦 (𝑢; 𝜃) = 1 𝑍(𝜃) 𝜈 (︀</formula></div>

Note that we have also emphasized the parametric dependence of the loss and the objective function on 𝑦 ∈ R 𝑘 , something we did not do in Section 1.2. The MAP estimator can be viewed as a function, for each 𝜃, 𝑢 MAP (•; 𝜃) : R 𝑘 → R 𝑑 : 𝑢 MAP (𝑦; 𝜃) ∈ arg min 𝑢∈R 𝑑 J(𝑢; 𝑦, 𝜃).</p><p>(For simplicity we assume that a unique point is determined by the minimization). We now introduce a loss function defined through a distance-like deterministic scoring rule D : R 𝑑 × R 𝑑 → R + , as defined in Definition 11.65; the canonical example is the squared Euclidean norm.

This is referred to as bilevel optimization because of the optimization to find 𝑢 MAP which is used within the optimization to find 𝜃 ⋆ . This procedure corresponds to hyperparameter tuning of 𝜃 on the validation set {𝑦 (𝑛) , 𝑢 (𝑛) } 𝑁 𝑛=1 . In practice the determination of 𝜃 ⋆ is implemented using 𝛾 𝑁 , the approximation of 𝛾 found from empirical samples:</p><formula xml:id="formula_112">𝜃 ⋆ ∈ arg min 𝜃∈Θ 1 𝑁 𝑁 ∑︁ 𝑛=1 D (︀ 𝑢 (𝑛) , 𝑢 MAP (𝑦 (𝑛) ; 𝜃) )︀ .</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Learning Priors For Posterior Approximation</head><p>In this section we generalize the setting from the previous one to the more general problem of learning parameters in the prior to best approximate the posterior. We work under the following data assumption, which differs from that in the previous section: we assume only marginal samples from 𝛾, but this is compensated for by employing evaluation of the likelihood. Data Assumption 5.2. We are able to evaluate the likelihood l(𝑦|𝑢) for any pair (𝑦, 𝑢) ∈ R 𝑘 × R 𝑑 . We are given data in the form of independent samples {𝑦 (𝑛) } 𝑁 𝑛=1 from the marginal distribution 𝜅 and independent samples {𝑢 (𝑛) } 𝑁 𝑛=1 from the prior distribution 𝜌.</p><p>Remark 5.3. In the preceding Data Assumption 5.2 the set of independent samples {𝑦 (𝑛) } 𝑁 𝑛=1 and the set of independent samples {𝑢 (𝑛) } 𝑁 𝑛=1 do not need to be independent of one another, and the same number of each is not required. However, in practice they are often found by marginalizing the data set of samples {(𝑦 (𝑛) , 𝑢 (𝑛) )} 𝑁 𝑛=1 from the joint distribution 𝛾 and then it is natural to have the same number of samples of each. ♢ It is again helpful to recall the notation from Remark 1.4. The goal is to choose parameters 𝜃 in the prior so that the resulting posterior 𝜋 𝑦 (𝑢; 𝜃) in (5.2) is as close as possible to the true posterior 𝜋 𝑦 (𝑢) corresponding to the joint distribution 𝛾(𝑦, 𝑢) = P(𝑦|𝑢)𝜌(𝑢) underlying the data given in Data Assumption 5.2.

First note that 𝛾(𝑦, 𝑢) = 𝜋 𝑦 (𝑢)𝜅(𝑦).

In particular this requires only marginal samples from 𝛾, and does not require knowledge of the posterior -evaluation of the likelihood is sufficient.</p><p>Remark 5.5. The expected KL divergence in (5.7) can also be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_117">E 𝑦 [︁ D KL (︀ 𝜋 𝑦 ‖𝜋 𝑦 𝜃 (•; 𝜃) )︀ ]︁ = ∫︁ 𝜌(𝑢)[log 𝜌(𝑢) -log 𝜌(𝑢; 𝜃)] 𝑑𝑢 + ∫︁ 𝜅(𝑦) log (︃ 𝑍 𝑦 (𝜃) 𝑍 𝑦 )︃ 𝑑𝑦. = D KL (︀ 𝜌‖𝜌(•; 𝜃) )︀ -D KL (︀ 𝜅‖𝜅(•; 𝜃) )︀</formula><p>, where in the last line we recognize that the normalizing constants 𝑍 𝑦 , 𝑍 𝑦 (𝜃) are equivalent to the marginal distributions of the observations 𝜅(𝑦)</p><formula xml:id="formula_118">= ∫︀ 𝜈 (︀ 𝑦 -𝐺(𝑢 ′ ) )︀ 𝜌(𝑢 ′ ) 𝑑𝑢 ′ and 𝜅(𝑦; 𝜃) = ∫︀ 𝜈 (︀ 𝑦 -𝐺(𝑢 ′ ) )︀</formula><p>𝜌(𝑢 ′ ; 𝜃) 𝑑𝑢 ′ , respectively. Thus, the objective in (5.5) involves two competing terms, the first relating only to the prior and the second only to the likelihood. Note that when this objective is to be approximated by means of empirical samples from 𝜌 and 𝜅, undefined terms arise in both divergences; these terms are 𝜃-independent and can be removed as we did to arrive at (5.8). See Remark 13.4 for discussion of this point in the canonical context of maximum likelihood density estimation. ♢</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5.1">Consequences Of Block-Triangular Pushforward</head><p>In this setting the approach we introduce is to construct a map to approximate the joint distribution 𝛾(𝑦, 𝑢) in such a way that we can extract the 𝑦-parameterized family of conditionals 𝜋 𝑦 (𝑢). To this end, we make the following assumption:</p><p>Assumption 5.12. Let 𝜚(𝑦, 𝑢) = 𝜚 1 (𝑦)𝜚 2 (𝑢) be a product reference density on R 𝑘 × R 𝑑 and 𝑇 : R 𝑘 × R 𝑑 → R 𝑘 × R 𝑑 be a transport map with the property that the joint density 𝛾(𝑦, 𝑢) = 𝜅(𝑦)𝜋 𝑦 (𝑢) is a pushforward under 𝑇 , i.e., 𝛾 = 𝑇 ♯ 𝜚. Assume also that 𝑇 is block-triangular: 2 𝑇 (𝑦, 𝑢) = [︃ 𝑇 1 (𝑦) 𝑇 2 (𝑦, 𝑢) ]︃ , (5.13) where 𝑇 1 : R 𝑘 → R 𝑘 is invertible and 𝑇 2 (𝑦, •) : R 𝑑 → R 𝑑 is invertible for every 𝑦 ∈ R 𝑘 . Remark 5.13. We discuss training based on the pushforward of a block-triangular map in Subsection 5.5.2, a context in which 𝑇 -1 arises. To avoid inverting the map during training, it is often convenient to directly work with the inverse map 𝑆 := 𝑇 -1 . For a block-triangular 𝑇 , the inverse 𝑆 is also a block-triangular map of the form 𝑆(𝑦, 𝑢) = [︃ 𝑆 1 (𝑦) 𝑆 2 (𝑦, 𝑢) ]︃ , (5.14) where 𝑆 1 : R 𝑘 → R 𝑘 is the inverse of 𝑇 1 and 𝑆 2 (𝑦, •) : R 𝑑 → R 𝑑 is the inverse of 𝑇 2 (𝑇 -1 1 (𝑦), •) for each 𝑦 ∈ R 𝑘 . By writing 𝑇 ♯ 𝜚 = (𝑆 -1</p><p>) ♯ 𝜚, the push-forward density can be more easily evaluated in terms of the map 𝑆, rather than the inverse of 𝑇 . As well as being useful computationally, these definitions of 𝑆 1 , 𝑆 2 simplify various expressions in the proof of the following theorem. ♢</p><p>The next theorem motivates the choice of tensor-product reference measure: such a choice ensures that the block-triangular form of 𝑇 provides a map that can be used to readily characterize the posterior density.</p><p>Theorem 5.14. Let Assumption 5.12 hold. Then (𝑇 1 ) ♯ 𝜚 1 = 𝜅 and</p><formula xml:id="formula_129">𝑇 2 (𝑇 -1 1 (𝑦), •) ♯ 𝜚 2 = 𝜋 𝑦 . (<label>5</label></formula><p>.15) Remark 5.15. The theorem shows that, if 𝑤 ∼ 𝜚 2 then 𝑇 2 (︀ 𝑇 -1 1 (𝑦), 𝑤 )︀</p><p>∼ 𝜋 𝑦 . Choosing 𝜚 2 to be an easy distribution to sample, and learning 𝑇 from data, then leads to a method for sampling from the posterior. In other words, imposing block-triangular structure on the map and the product form for the reference measure yields a map that meets our goal of characterizing the posterior distribution. ♢ Proof of Theorem 5.14.

While a block-triangular map can sample from conditional distributions, it does not uniquely determine a particular map with the desired property. Indeed, when such a map exists, there may exist an infinite number of maps with the structure in Assumption 5.12. We refer to Section 13.2 for discussion of computational methods to find transports from data. ♢ Remark 5.17.</p><p>The reference measure 𝜚 is a degree of freedom in the measure transport framework. A useful choice is 𝜚(𝑦, 𝑢) = 𝜅(𝑦)𝜚 2 (𝑢); that is, to choose 𝜚 1 (𝑦) = 𝜅(𝑦). It then follows that the identity map 𝑇 1 (𝑦) = 𝑦 is a valid transport, trivially pushing forward 𝜚 1 (𝑦) = 𝜅(𝑦) to 𝜅(𝑦). This choice avoids the inversion of 𝑇 1 in (5.15) and makes sampling from 𝜋 1 straightforward: once we have determined 𝑇 2 compatible with this choice of 𝑇 1 then for all 𝑦 ∼ 𝜅 we have 𝑇 2 (𝑦, 𝑢) ∼ 𝜋 𝑦 , for 𝑢 ∼ 𝜚 2 . ♢ Example 5.18.

In this subsection we discuss the learning of block-triangular transport maps, given data pairs {(𝑦 (𝑛) , 𝑢 (𝑛) )} 𝑁 𝑛=1 from the joint distribution 𝛾(𝑦, 𝑢), as in Assumption 5.2. Let 𝜃 ∈ Θ ⊆ R 𝑝 denote the parameters of the block-triangular map 𝑇 (𝑢, 𝑦; 𝜃) given by (5.13). Our goal is to find the optimal parameters by minimizing the KL divergence between the pushforward distribution 𝑇 ♯ 𝜚 and the joint distribution 𝛾.

Compare with the minimization problems (4.2) and (5.11) for which the reference measure appears in the left-hand argument of D KL (•‖•). This choice is dictated by the form of the data, drawn from the joint distribution; and specifically drawn by sampling from prior on 𝑢 and then from likelihood on 𝑦|𝑢. The following theorem shows that the optimal parameters can then be identified from an optimization objective that only depends on the joint distribution 𝛾(𝑦, 𝑢) through an expectation, and hence can be solved using an empirical approximation of the objective. ♢ Remark 5.20. In implementation, the distribution 𝛾 in the optimization problem <ref type="bibr">(5.20)</ref> is replaced by an empirical approximation. Using the form of the KL divergence, the optimization problem takes the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_153">𝜃 * = arg min 𝜃 1 𝑁 𝑁 ∑︁ 𝑖=1 -log 𝑇 (•; 𝜃) ♯ 𝜚(𝑦 𝑖 , 𝑢 𝑖 ).</formula><p>Thus, the optimal solution 𝜃 * computed in practice corresponds to solving the maximum likelihood problem for the parameters under the model 𝑇 (•; 𝜃) ♯ 𝜚.

In Section 6.2 we formulate the filtering (Subsection 6.2.1) and smoothing (Subsection 6.2.2) problems in detail. In Sections 6.3 and 6.4, respectively, we describe algorithms for the filtering and smoothing approaches to data assimilation. Subsection 6.3.1 recalls the Kalman filter, applicable in the linear and Gaussian setting. Subsections 6.3.2, 6.3.3, 6.3.4 and 6.3.5 recall 3DVar, the extended Kalman filter (ExKF), the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) and the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF); Subsections 6.3.6 and 6.3.7 concern the bootstrap particle filter and the optimal particle filter approaches to filtering. Subsection 6.4.1 is devoted to the 4DVar approach to smoothing, Subsection 6.4.2 discusses the strong constraint variant, and the subject of reanalysis is overviewed in Subsection 6.4.3. In Section 6.5 we discuss model error in the context of filtering and smoothing problems and Section 6.6 is devoted to the study of surrogate modeling, for both filtering and smoothing.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.1">Notation</head><p>To state the inverse problems of interest precisely, we make the following definitions: for a given and fixed integer 𝐽, and for 1 ≤ 𝑗 ≤ 𝐽,</p><formula xml:id="formula_185">𝑉 † :={𝑣 † 0 , . . . , 𝑣 † 𝐽 }, 𝑉 † 𝑗 := {𝑣 † 0 , . . . , 𝑣 † 𝑗 },<label>(6.3a</label></formula><p>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_186">𝑌 † :={𝑦 † 1 , . . . , 𝑦 † 𝐽 }, 𝑌 † 𝑗 := {𝑦 † 1 , . . . , 𝑦 † 𝑗 }.<label>(6.3b)</label></formula><p>The sequence 𝑉 † is often termed the signal and the sequence 𝑌 † the data. It is sometimes helpful to define 𝑌 † 0 as the empty set ∅. We use the † notation throughout Part II of the notes, devoted to data assimilation, to denote all quantities associated with the underlying model for signal and data. We adopt this convention because many of the algorithms that we develop for data assimilation will use the signal and/or data models (6.1), (6.2) as part of their backbone. We will use symbols 𝑣 𝑗 , or for ensemble algorithms 𝑣 (𝑛) 𝑗 with 𝑛 indexing particles in the ensemble, for the outputs of algorithms to find the state {𝑣 † 𝑗 } over some set of time indices 𝑗 ∈ {0, 1, . . . , 𝐽} based on realized observations 𝑌 † . We will also use the notation ̂︀ 𝑣 𝑗+1 , or for ensemble algorithms (̂︀ 𝑣</p><formula xml:id="formula_187">(𝑛) 𝑗+1 , ̂︀ 𝑦 (𝑛)<label>𝑗+1</label></formula><p>), for predictions made as part of algorithms; in particular for predictions of the state 𝑣 † 𝑗+1 at time 𝑗 + 1 using only data up to time 𝑗. These predictions are then corrected, using the observed data 𝑦 † 𝑗+1 , to yield the output of algorithms at time 𝑗 + 1.</p><p>By adopting this notational convention we distinguish between the output of the underlying signal and/or data models (6.1), (6.2) (𝑣 and 𝑦 symbols with †) and algorithms to estimate the signal (𝑣 and 𝑦 symbols without †); this serves to avoid confusion between the source of data, and the algorithms for data assimilation, when the latter also use the underlying signal and/or data models as part of their definition. We do not use the † convention in Part I of the notes, devoted to inverse problems, because the algorithms we study do not have the same potential for confusion with output of the underlying inverse problem model (1.1). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.2">Filtering versus Smoothing</head><p>There are two core problems in data assimilation, one known as filtering, and the other as smoothing. Both use:</p><p>Data Assumption 6.3. Data 𝑌 † ∈ R 𝐽𝑘 is given and is assumed to have come from the dynamics model (6.1) and the data model (6.2).</p><p>The filtering distribution at time</p><formula xml:id="formula_188">𝑗 is P(𝑣 † 𝑗 |𝑌 † 𝑗 ): the distribution of the state 𝑣 † 𝑗 ∈ R 𝑑 at time 𝑗, conditioned on data 𝑌 † 𝑗 ∈ R 𝑘𝑗</formula><p>. This distribution at time 𝑗 is defined without knowledge of future observations at times 𝑗 ′ &gt; 𝑗. We say that this distribution is timecausal. The objective of filtering is to find P(𝑣 † 𝑗 |𝑌 † 𝑗 ) for each 𝑗 ∈ {1, . . . , 𝐽}, sequentially. The smoothing distribution is P(𝑉 † |𝑌 † ), a probability density function on an entire sequence of states 𝑉 † given the entire dataset 𝑌 † ; note that 𝑉 † ∈ R 𝑑(𝐽+1) and 𝑌 † ∈ R 𝑘𝐽 represent sequences over a window of length 𝐽 + 1 and 𝐽, respectively. The objective of smoothing is to find P(𝑉 † |𝑌 † ). For 0 ≤ 𝑗 ≤ 𝐽 -1, the marginal distribution of the smoothing distribution corresponding to time 𝑗, P(𝑣 † 𝑗 |𝑌 † ), depends on observations at times 𝑗 ′ &gt; 𝑗, highlighting an essential difference between filtering and smoothing.</p><p>The smoothing problem is an example of a single Bayesian inverse problem of the type defined in Chapter 1. The filtering problem comprises 𝐽 Bayesian inverse problems, interleaved with predictions of the model. We now describe the Bayesian perspective on filtering and on smoothing. In smoothing the prior on 𝑉 † is a probability density function defined by (6.1); the posterior is found by conditioning this prior on data 𝑌 † defined by (6.2). In filtering, at time 𝑗 + 1, the prior is given by P(𝑣 † 𝑗+1 |𝑌 † 𝑗 ) which itself is defined by combining P(𝑣 † 𝑗 |𝑌 † 𝑗 ) with the dynamics model (6.1); thus we see that the prior for the filtering distribution at time 𝑗 + 1 is defined by combining the filtering distribution at time 𝑗 with the dynamics model (6.1). The posterior P(𝑣 † 𝑗+1 |𝑌 † 𝑗+1 ) is then found by conditioning the prior on observation 𝑦 † 𝑗+1 using the data model (6.2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.3">Probabilistic versus State Estimation</head><p>When trying to solve these Bayesian formulations of the filtering and smoothing problems, we will refer to probabilistic estimation. The underlying inverse problems are solved in a Bayesian fashion. On the other hand many optimization-based filtering and smoothing algorithms exist with the aim being simply to estimate the state itself, conditioned on data. We refer to this as state estimation. State estimation may be thought of as being analogous to MAP estimation, from Subsection 1.2.1, in the general Bayesian inverse problem setting. Indeed, for the smoothing problem, the MAP estimator associated with the posterior distribution on 𝑉 † is frequently employed as a point estimator of the state. The situation is more complicated for filtering; this is because the sequential nature of the problem means that we only have access to approximate priors, often in the form of point masses, or a Gaussian, at best, and iterative computation of the MAP estimator is not always natural. Nonetheless, useful algorithms for state estimation do exist in filtering and they will play an important role in what follows.</p></div>

Because filtering is defined by conditioning on data arriving sequentially, such algorithms may be used online, the probability distribution over states being updated every time a new data point 𝑦 † 𝑗 arrives. Smoothing gives rise to methodologies that are most naturally used, in their most basic form, in an offline fashion. However, smoothing algorithms may also be used sequentially, in block form with respect to discrete time index 𝑗, as we now explain.</p><p>In the above we assumed data 𝑦 † 𝑗 given on the index set 𝑗 ∈ {1, . . . , 𝐽} and solved the smoothing problem on 𝑗 ∈ {0, . . . , 𝐽}. However this can be shifted to solve the inverse problem on any interval, for example containing 𝐾 + 1 points for some integer 𝐾, using data on an interval excluding the first point, but provided with an initial Gaussian distribution at the first point. Let 𝐾 ≪ 𝐽 be such an integer. We first solve the smoothing problem defined on the index set 𝑗 ∈ {0, . . . , 𝐾}. Taking the solution at time 𝐾 as starting point we may then solve a smoothing problem on index set 𝑗 ∈ {𝐾, . . . , 2𝐾}. This idea may be iterated, working on index set 𝑗 ∈ {ℓ𝐾, . . . , (ℓ+1)𝐾}, then on index set 𝑗 ∈ {(ℓ + 1)𝐾, . . . , (ℓ + 2)𝐾} and so on. If ℓ = 0, . . . , 𝐿 -1 then this will deliver a solution to the data assimilation problem for 𝑣 † 𝑗 defined on 𝑗 ∈ {0, . . . , 𝐽} where 𝐽 = 𝐿𝐾. Such methods are known as fixed-interval smoothers and may be thought of as blending aspects of smoothing and filtering, when iterated over ℓ. At overlap points, which are a multiple of 𝐾, some form of Gaussian projection (see Remark 2.11) will be needed to restart the process on the next time-interval as the assumption made above is that the initial condition is Gaussian; however, this assumption on the initial distribution can be relaxed. The case 𝐾 = 1 delivers the filtering distribution if the Gaussian projection is omitted. ♢</p></div>

They all take the form of nonautonomous dynamical systems, defined on state spaces of varying dimension. They are nonautonomous because they are driven by the observation sequence {𝑦 † 𝑗 } 𝑗∈N ; the dimension varies depending on whether a simple state estimate is evolved (3DVar), a mean and covariance are evolved (Kalman filter or the extended Kalman filter), or an ensemble is evolved (ensemble Kalman filter, bootstrap particle filter, optimal particle filter).

However, they often need inflation and localization to perform well for high-dimensional systems, for chaotic dynamical systems, and for small ensemble sizes. Inflation and localization are discussed in the following two paragraphs.</p><p>Inflation For simplicity we confine the discussion to the case of linear observation operator ℎ(•) = 𝐻 • . The EnKF gain is then determined by ̂︀  𝐶 𝑗+1 (𝑁 ), as explained in Remark 6.11. We assume that the covariance at infinite sample size 𝑁 = ∞ , ̂︀ 𝐶 𝑗+1 , leads to the optimal gain; this is provably true for linear Ψ, as discussed in the bibliography. From this perspective, EnKFs suffer from sampling error due to finite ensemble size 𝑁 . When sampling error in the forecast covariance matrix ︀ 𝐶 𝑗+1 (𝑁 ) leads to underestimation of the analysis covariance 𝐶 𝑗+1 , this can lead to filter divergence, whereby repeated underestimation of the forecast covariance causes the filter to put increasingly more weight on the forecasts than observations, eventually becoming unresponsive to observations. We provide two examples to illustrate the underestimation of the analysis covariance.</p><p>Example 6.13. Suppose that we assimilate a scalar observation of the 𝑏 th variable into the 𝑎 th variable. Thus 𝐻 is a 1 × 𝑑 vector with entry 1 in the 𝑏 th position and zeros elsewhere. Since the phenomenon we wish to illustrate occurs at any fixed time, we simply let 𝐶 and ̂︀ 𝐶 represent the desired infinite sample size covariances, and 𝐶(𝑁 ) and ̂︀ 𝐶(𝑁 ) the finite sample size estimators coming from the EnKF. Now, we claim that</p><formula xml:id="formula_250">E[ (︀ 𝐶(𝑁 ) )︀ 𝑎𝑎 ] - (︀ ̂︀ 𝐶(𝑁 ) )︀ 𝑎𝑎 = -( ̂︀ 𝐶(𝑁 )) 2 𝑎𝑏 (︀ ̂︀ 𝐶(𝑁 ) )︀ 𝑏𝑏 + (Γ) 𝑏𝑏 , (<label>6.36)</label></formula><p>where the expectation is taken with respect to the observation perturbations 𝜂 (𝑛)</p><p>𝑗 . References that substantiate this claim can be found in the bibliography Section 6.8. Next, suppose that variables with indices 𝑎 and 𝑏 are in fact uncorrelated, so that ( ̂︀ 𝐶) 𝑎𝑏 = 0. When estimated with a finite ensemble, in an implementation of the EnKF, the estimated ( ̂︀ 𝐶) 𝑎𝑏 ̸ = 0, due to sampling error resulting from a finite ensemble. This leads to a spurious reduction in the analysis covariance, with respect to its value in the infinite-ensemble case. ♢ Example 6.14. Inflation is also used to compensate for an unknown, or ignored, Σ, a form of model error. If the 𝜉 (𝑛) 𝑗 are excluded in (6.28a), then the covariance ̂︀ 𝐶 𝑗+1 will be underestimated in <ref type="bibr">(6.32a)</ref>. ♢</p><p>The underestimation of the analysis covariance can be mitigated by inflating the covariance of the forecast ensemble, although it can also be applied to the analysis ensemble instead. The most common form of inflation is multiplicative inflation, whereby the forecast ensemble is modified as</p><formula xml:id="formula_251">︀ 𝑣 (𝑛) 𝑗+1 → ̂︀ 𝑚 𝑗+1 + 𝛼(̂︀ 𝑣 (𝑛) 𝑗+1 -̂︀ 𝑚 𝑗+1 ),<label>(6.37)</label></formula><p>with 𝛼 ≥ 1 being the inflation parameter. This corresponds to scaling the covariance ︀ 𝐶 𝑗+1 by 𝛼 2 . Theoretical results on the impact of sampling error on EnKFs, including results on the optimal value of the inflation parameter under assumptions on the model dynamics, are referenced in the bibliography Section 6.8.</p><p>Localization In addition to the undersampling effects from the previous paragraph, further negative impacts of sampling errors on EnKFs can arise in spatially extended systems. In such physical systems there is typically decay of correlations with distance; but sampling error can induce spurious long-range correlations. In the empirical covariance matrices computed by the EnKFs, nearby points in space are likely to be truly correlated, while ones that are farther apart may only have spurious correlations dominated by sampling error. These spurious correlations not only lead to an underestimation of the analysis covariance, as discussed in Example 6.13, but also lead to degraded state estimation due to spurious information transfer between uncorrelated variables.</p><p>Localization is introduced to damp covariances, within the empirical covariance matrices computed by the EnKF, according to physical distance (for discretization of PDE problems) or index distance (for large ODEs with notion of index locality). A common way of implementing localization is by taking the Hadamard product<ref type="foot" target="#foot_6">foot_6</ref> of the empirical covariance with a localization matrix 𝐿:</p><formula xml:id="formula_252">︀ 𝐶 𝑗+1 → 𝐿 ∘ ̂︀ 𝐶 𝑗+1 . (6.38)</formula><p>Typically, 𝐿 is constructed such that the covariance between between variables indexed by 𝑎 and by 𝑏 is exponentially damped according to a measure of distance<ref type="foot" target="#foot_7">foot_7</ref> d(𝑎, 𝑏) between them, scaled by characteristic length scale ℓ:</p><formula xml:id="formula_253">(𝐿) 𝑎𝑏 = 𝑒 -d(𝑎,𝑏) 2 /ℓ 2 . (6.39)</formula><p>The choice of ℓ will depend on the ensemble size, the correlation scales in the system, and the time between analysis steps (since this will control how far information has had time to propagate). Localization can also be implemented in other ways that scale better to high-dimensional problems, such as domain localization and observation localization, discussed in the bibliography Section 6.8; we will restrict our discussion to covariance localization (6.38).</p><p>Remark 6.15. If ℎ(•) is linear, the localized ̂︀ 𝐶 𝑗+1 is used to compute the gain according to (6.32b). If ℎ(•) is nonlinear, then localization needs to be applied to both ̂︀ 𝐶 𝑣ℎ 𝑗+1 and</p><formula xml:id="formula_254">︀ 𝐶 ℎℎ 𝑗+1 . If function ℎ(•)</formula><p>is such that each observation has a corresponding spatial location, then localization can be applied as discussed above. If some observations correspond to, for example, spatially integrated quantities, then localization is not straightforward to apply; see the bibliography Section 6.8. ♢ Remark 6.16. Besides the sampling error considerations discussed above, localization is also important in increasing the rank of the forecast covariance matrix. When the ensemble size 𝑁 is less than the system dimension 𝑑, the forecast covariance will be rank deficient. This implies that the analysis ensemble will lie in the span of the forecast ensemble, and thus that analysis increments are restricted to an 𝑁 -dimensional subspace.

The BPF is provably convergent to the true filtering distribution as 𝑁 → ∞, under quite general conditions, including filtering distributions that are far from Gaussian; this should be contrasted with ensemble methods as discussed in Remark 6.10.

Following the roadmap dictated by (6.43), the OPF first incorporates the observation 𝑦 † 𝑗+1 by evaluating the likelihood weights P(𝑦 † 𝑗+1 |𝑣 𝑗 ). The algorithm then samples from the probability density function p 𝑗+1 := P(̂︀ 𝑣 𝑗+1 |𝑣 𝑗 , 𝑦 † 𝑗+1 ), weighting the samples by using the weights P(𝑦 † 𝑗+1 |𝑣 𝑗 ). Carrying this out for every candidate particle 𝑣 𝑗 = 𝑣 (𝑛) 𝑗 gives the sampled particles and weights (̂︀ 𝑣 (𝑛) 𝑗+1 , 𝑤 (𝑛) 𝑗+1</p><p>), and hence defines (6.45).

Optimality here refers to minimizing the variance of the weights, in one step of the filter, over a wide class of possible particle-based methods. Once cycled through multiple steps 𝑗, this optimality property is lost. Nonetheless the approach of using the data to predict is natural. Indeed the OPF has a clear potential advantage over the BPF: the predictive kernel in the OPF, p 𝑗+1 , incorporates knowledge of the current observation 𝑦 † 𝑗+1 . In contrast, the predictive kernel in the BPF simply predicts with the unconditioned forecast kernel P, drawing samples from P(𝑣 𝑗+1 |𝑣 𝑗 ) without knowledge of 𝑦 † 𝑗+1 , and then reweights them to reflect the observation. ♢</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.8">Evaluating Probabilistic Estimation</head><p>In this subsection we describe a widely used methodology for evaluating probabilistic estimation of the filtering distribution. The following theorem shows that the filtering distribution has an interesting property: its variance, averaged over the marginal distribution on observations, equals the squared bias in its mean, averaged over the joint distribution of the state and observations. Theorem 6.19. In the following, the pair (𝑣 † 𝑗 , 𝑌 † 𝑗 ) is distributed according to the joint distribution under the dynamics/data model (6.1), (6.2), with expectation denoted</p><formula xml:id="formula_272">E (𝑣 † 𝑗 ,𝑌 † 𝑗 ) ,</formula></div>

Definition 6.21. Consider a sequence of probabilistic forecasts {𝜋 alg 𝑗 } 𝐽 𝑗=1 .

The ratio in Theorem 6.19 averages over the marginal on the data and over the joint distribution of the state and observation. The spread-error ratio, however, replaces these expectation by averaging over the observations along a single trajectory; this reflects the fact that that only a single trajectory is available in practice. Nonetheless, the ratio serves as a heuristic for evaluating an algorithm. If 𝑟 = 1, we say that the approximate filtering distributions {𝜋 alg 𝑗 } 𝐽 𝑗=1 have a perfect spread-error relationship. If 𝑟 &lt; 1, we say that they are underdispersed. If 𝑟 &gt; 1, we say that they are overdispersed. Ratios other than 1 are also used, reflecting the heuristic derivation of 𝑟 as an approximation of the exact value 1 that is obtained in Theorem 6. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">19</ref>. ♢</p></div>

An important feature of reanalysis is that it consolidates possibly sparse, irregular observations to give, at every time step, a complete state estimate of the system on the model state space, one which also incorporates information from the model dynamics. The extent to which the information from observed parts of the system can transfer to unobserved parts is formalized under the concept of observability; see the bibliography Section 6.8 for references. Reanalysis datasets, due to the impact of the observations, are often assumed to exhibit lower effects from model error (see Section 6.5), in contrast to the raw forecasts produced by the model. This is discussed in Subsection 8.2.3. Both because the output of reanalysis is produced on a regular grid, and because it is thought to exhibit lower model error, reanalyses are often used to train ML forecast models.</p></div>

Theorem 6.26 highlights that running the 3DVar algorithm for long times can prevent small model error from accumulating. Moreover, this model error only needs to be controlled in the unobserved directions. That is, the overall error of the recovered state will be small if (𝐼 -𝐾𝐻)𝑏 𝑗 is small for all 𝑗, rather than the overall model error 𝑏 𝑗 being small. Ideally, the gain 𝐾 in 3DVar is chosen such that the conditions in the assumption of Theorem 6.26 hold. See the bibliography Section 6.8 for one such guarantee under an observability condition. ♢ Remark 6.28. As discussed in the bibliography Section 6.8, similar accuracy results can be established for other filtering algorithms. These results rely on observability conditions on the true dynamics and observation model (Ψ, 𝐻) and on accuracy of the surrogate model Ψ ′ in the unobserved part of the state-space. Notice that in Theorem 6.26 we do not assume long-time accuracy or stability of the surrogate dynamics defined by Ψ ′ , or of the true dynamics defined by Ψ, but we can nevertheless obtain long-time accuracy of filtering estimates by leveraging the stability properties of the map (𝐼 -𝐾𝐻)Ψ; this is a form of observability. ♢</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.7">Generalizations</head><p>Here we conclude with some remarks on generalizations of the setting we adopt in this chapter. First we observe that the stochastic dynamics model (6.1) and data model (6.2) are readily generalized to settings in which the maps Ψ(•) and ℎ(•), as well as the covariances Σ and Γ, are dependent on the time-index 𝑗. It is also possible to allow degenerate noises (positive semi-definite), and the case where no noise is present in the dynamics (Σ ≡ 0) arises frequently. Furthermore, all the algorithms in this chapter, except for the Kalman filter which leverages Gaussian structure, admit generalizations to settings in which the noises {𝜉 † 𝑗 } 𝑗∈Z + , {𝜂 † 𝑗 } 𝑗∈N are independent i.i.d. centered but non-Gaussian sequences. Adding correlation to the noises is also possible. For example it is possible to consider correlation across the discrete time index 𝑗. This significantly complicates filtering, but it is possible to accommodate it if the noise itself is generated by a Markov process. Adding correlation to the noises across the discrete time index 𝑗 also complicates smoothing, but can also be handled, typically at additional computational cost. In addition, allowing for correlation between the dynamics and observational noise is also possible. Finally we note that assuming differentiability, or even continuity, of the maps Ψ(•) and ℎ(•) is also not necessary; however assuming differentiability of Ψ(•) and ℎ(•) facilitates specific filtering methods such as the ExKF and gradient-based algorithms for smoothing methodologies such as 4DVar.</p></div>

Since these variants avoid the construction of the covariance matrices, localization is often implemented in these filters through domain localization, where the spatial domain is divided into multiple areas, and analyses done locally in each. A popular EnKF variant that uses domain localization is the local ensemble transform Kalman filter (LETKF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b242">[222]</ref>.</p><p>We note that besides the considerations about spurious correlations and forecast covariance rank discussed in the chapter, localization can also be interpreted in a dynamical systems context. For an EnKF, one generally needs enough ensemble members to span the unstable-neutral subspace, corresponding to the number of nonnegative Lyapunov exponents, in order to prevent filter divergence. This observation is supported by the fact that, in the case of linear dynamics, the forecast covariance matrix will collapse onto the unstable-neutral subspace; see the early work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b437">[417]</ref> and the review of data assimilation for chaotic dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[85]</ref> for references to these results. It has been observed, however, that dynamical systems such as the atmosphere are locally low dimensional <ref type="bibr" target="#b355">[335,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b344">324]</ref>; that is, the dynamics within a spatial region may have a significantly lower dimension (as quantified by the dimension of the subspace spanned by the fastest growing modes) than that of the entire system, implying that filtering may be successful with a small ensemble when localization is applied.</p><p>For an introduction to the particle filter see <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">[129]</ref>.

Convergence of 𝜃 ⋆ = 𝜃 ⋆ (𝐽), as a function of 𝐽, can be used to determine a value of 𝐽 sufficient for amortization. Alternatively, amortization may be tackled by considering learning problems defined over multiple realizations of the data 𝑌 † ; see Chapters 5 and 10. ♢ Remark 7.6. To be able to employ algorithms based on the objective function (7.8) it is necessary that the KL divergence between 𝑞 𝑗+1 (𝜃), given by (7.7), and P𝑞 𝑗 (𝜃), is well-defined and that we are able to compute it. In Section 7.5 we give an example of how this may be done for a class of algorithms that maintains 𝑞 𝑗 (𝜃), and P𝑞 𝑗 (𝜃), in Gaussian form. In Subsection 9.4.1 we show how the ideas may be used for ensemble methods where the KL divergence is not defined; we extract Gaussian approximations from the empirical distributions defined by the ensemble method. ♢</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3">Imposing Filtering Structure On Smoothing</head><p>An alternative way to use variational Bayes to derive filtering algorithms is to start from the variational formulation of smoothing and then impose a temporal structure on the resulting density, to enforce filtering; specifically to impose that the probability density function for state 𝑣 † 𝑗 at time 𝑗 only depends on past observations 𝑌 † 𝑗 , as defined in (6.3), and not future observations. In order to approximate a filtering distribution it is natural to seek minimizers of J(•) defined by (7.2a) which factorize in the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_343">𝑞(𝑉 † ) = 𝐽 ∏︁ 𝑖=1 q 𝑖 (𝑣 † 𝑖 |𝑉 † 𝑖-1 ; 𝑌 † 𝑖 )q 0 (𝑣 † 0 ); (7.11)</formula><p>thus 𝑞 ∈ 𝒫 𝐽 .

(7.12)</formula><p>We let 𝒞 𝐽 ⊂ 𝒫 𝐽 denote probability density functions of the form <ref type="bibr">(7.11)</ref>. The use of symbol 𝒞 is to invoke the conditional structure in terms of the dependence of q 𝑖 on only 𝑌 † 𝑖 (recalling the convention, from Subsection 6.1.1, that 𝑌 † 0 = ∅). The smoothing distribution is, in general, contained in 𝒫 𝐽 ∖𝒞 𝐽 . This is since the conditional distribution of 𝑣 † 𝑖 |𝑉 𝑖-1 will, for smoothing, depend on 𝑌 † and not just on 𝑌 † 𝑖 .</p><p>Remark 7.7. Ideally we would like to minimize the loss function J(•) defined in (7.2a) over probability measures of the form <ref type="bibr">(7.11)</ref>. This, however, will not lead to a minimizer which is an element of 𝒞 𝐽 ; even if we prescribe the functional form of each q 𝑖 (𝑣 † 𝑖 |𝑉 † 𝑖-1 ; •), that is the dependence on 𝑌 † 𝑖 , the learned parameters in q 𝑖 will depend on the entire sequence 𝑌 † and so the resulting learned model will not have the desired conditional form. In short, there is no mechanism to ensure dependence of q 𝑖 on only 𝑌 † 𝑖 , and not on the entirety of 𝑌 † , since we have access only to one realization of the data, under Data Assumption 7.2. Overcoming this may be achieved by using amortization, assuming access to multiple realizations of the observation data -see Subsection 10.2.1.</p><p>♢</p><p>We now describe a way of circumventing the issue highlighted in Remark 7.7. The resulting methodology involves minimization of a sequence of objective functions J 𝑗 (•) each of which only sees 𝑌 † 𝑗 .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chapter 8 Learning The Prior For Data Assimilation</head><p>This chapter is devoted to learning priors for smoothing and filtering problems. In the smoothing problem, the prior is determined by the stochastic dynamics model; thus, in this chapter we will consider learning the dynamics model, along with the state, from data. In the filtering problem, there is a prior at each time point, found by predicting with the dynamics model, starting from an approximation of the filtering distribution; this prior is then combined with a likelihood to incorporate the next observation. In this chapter, we will consider learning priors for the filtering step using Gaussian and particle-based approximations.</p><p>Learning priors for data assimilation is intimately related to the important problem of jointly estimating the state and parameters of a stochastic dynamics model; this problem is ubiquitous in data assimilation, and it arises whenever the available dynamics models are inaccurate or expensive to evaluate. When they are inaccurate it may be desirable to learn a correction which enhances their accuracy; when they are expensive it may be desirable to learn a cheap-to-evaluate surrogate. Such a correction or surrogate may be represented by a neural network, random features, or Gaussian process model, for example.</p><p>We addressed the topic of learning the prior for general inverse problems in Chapter 3 and that material may all be applied in the context of smoothing, viewed as an inverse problem. In particular Section 3.1 considers Bayesian hierarchical modeling in which the unknown parameter, and the parameters of the prior, are jointly learned from the single observation available. In this chapter we consider this Bayesian hierarchical problem in the context of the smoothing problem, learning the state of the system and parameters of the dynamics model simultaneously. To solve this joint estimation problem, we will leverage filtering algorithms to estimate the state.</p><p>We introduce the problem of learning priors for smoothing in Section 8.1. The next two sections discuss general methodologies for solving this problem. Section 8.2 describes the expectation-maximization (EM) framework for joint parameter and state estimation. In particular, we will present practical algorithmic instances of this framework to estimate parameters defining the dynamics map Ψ and/or the error covariance Σ. Section 8.3 discusses auto-differentiable Kalman filters, an approach to maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters that relies on Kalman-type algorithms to approximate the likelihood function, and on auto-differentiation to approximate its gradient. In Section 8.4 we discuss the learning of prior distributions for each step of the filtering problem, considering the use of empirical priors and Gaussian priors constructed from the outcome of the preceding step of the filtering process. Section 8.5 closes with extensions and bibliographical remarks.</p></div>

Here, 𝜗 are unknown parameters entering the definition of the dynamics map Ψ 𝜗 and we assume the error covariance Σ to be also, in general, unknown. We denote by 𝜃 := {𝜗, Σ} the collection of unknown parameters; it is possible to extend to parameterizations of the covariance Σ, rather than to learn the entire covariance matrix, as discussed in Remark 6.25, but we do not pursue this here. For a given and fixed integer 𝐽, we recall the following notation from Subsection 6.1.1:</p><formula xml:id="formula_368">𝑉 † := {𝑣 † 0 , . . . , 𝑣 † 𝐽 }, 𝑌 † := {𝑦 † 1 , . . . , 𝑦 † 𝐽 }.</formula><p>Note that 𝑉 † ∈ R (𝐽+1)𝑑 and 𝑌 † ∈ R 𝐽𝑘 . We make the following:</p><p>Data Assumption 8.1. Data 𝑌 † is given and assumed to come from the model <ref type="bibr">(8.1)</ref>.</p><p>Given data 𝑌 † we wish to recover the parameter 𝜃 defining the dynamics model. In this process some algorithms will estimate the state 𝑉 † as well. Furthermore, once 𝜃 is learned and the dynamics model is known, the filtering and smoothing algorithms from Chapter 6 can be used to estimate the state, using the same given data 𝑌 † or using new realizations of the data from the same system. The aim of determining parameters 𝜗 in the dynamics map Ψ 𝜗 from data resembles the task of supervised learning in Chapter 12. However, here we do not assume to have direct data {︀ 𝑣 (𝑛) , Ψ 𝜗 (𝑣 (𝑛) )</p><p>}︀ 𝑁 𝑛=1 to learn the parameter 𝜗. Instead, we only have access to data 𝑌 † obtained from indirect and noisy measurement of a trajectory 𝑉 † . It is then natural to seek to recover 𝑉 † as a step towards recovering 𝜃; this idea underlies the EM and auto-differentiable Kalman filtering algorithms introduced in the next two sections. Before presenting these algorithms, we consider three motivating examples for wishing to learn the parameter 𝜗 entering the definition of the dynamics map Ψ 𝜗 in (8.1a).</p><p>Example 8.2 (Parameterized Dynamics). The state dynamics may be governed by the flow of a parameterized system of differential equations, and we may be interested in estimating a parameter 𝜗 entering the definition of the vector field in the differential equations from data 𝑌 † . ♢ Example 8.3 (Fully Unknown Dynamics). The state dynamics may be fully unknown and 𝜗 may represent the parameters of, for example, a neural network, random features, or Gaussian process surrogate model Ψ 𝜗 ; see Chapter 12 for background on these parameterizations of functions. The goal is to find an accurate surrogate model Ψ 𝜗 . Even if the true dynamics were known, a surrogate model, or emulator, can be cheaper to evaluate, enabling the use of large sample sizes for particle filters or ensemble Kalman methods; see Section 6.6. Similar computational considerations motivate learning the forward map for inverse problems in Section 1.5. ♢ Example 8.4 (Model Correction). The dynamics may be unknown, but we may still have access to an inaccurate model Ψ approx . Here 𝜗 can represent, for example, the parameters of a neural network, random features, or Gaussian process Ψ correction 𝜗 used to correct the inaccurate model Ψ approx . The goal is to learn 𝜗 so that Ψ 𝜗 := Ψ approx + Ψ correction 𝜗</p><p>approximates the true dynamics of the state. Learning model corrections is important in applications where available models have moderate predictive accuracy. For instance, fine scales of the state may not be resolved accurately due to computational constraints, and we may be interested in learning a surrogate model from data which accounts for the unresolved scales of the system. ♢</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2">Expectation Maximization</head><p>In this section we work under Data Assumption 8.1, and so have access only to data 𝑌 † obtained from indirect and noisy measurement of a signal trajectory. We view the problem of estimating 𝜃 := {𝜗, Σ} from data 𝑌 † as a missing data problem: ideally we estimate 𝜃 from both 𝑉 † and 𝑌 † ; but the data 𝑉 † is missing and we must first estimate 𝑉 † from 𝑌 † . We adopt a maximum likelihood approach to the problem of estimating 𝜃 from 𝑌 † : we aim to maximize P(𝑌 † |𝜃). The premise of the methodology we now introduce is that evaluation of the likelihood function P(𝑌 † |𝜃) is challenging due to the missing, or latent, variable 𝑉 † ; but that the joint distribution P(𝑌 † , 𝑉 † |𝜃) is readily available. With this in mind we seek to address the problem of missing data by employing the identity</p><formula xml:id="formula_369">P(𝑌 † |𝜃) = ∫︁ P(𝑌 † , 𝑉 † |𝜃) 𝑑𝑉 = ∫︁ P(𝑌 † |𝑉 † , 𝜃) P(𝑉 † |𝜃) 𝑑𝑉 † .

Consequently, the maximum likelihood estimator of 𝜃 can be naturally computed by employing the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm described in Section 15.4. Specifically, in the notation of that section, we consider parameter 𝑢 := 𝜃, missing variable 𝑧 := 𝑉 † and data 𝑦 := 𝑌 † .</p><p>The identity <ref type="bibr">(15.16)</ref> shows that, in order to implement the EM algorithm, we need to identify the extended likelihood P(𝑌 † , 𝑉 † |𝜃).

Then 𝜃 ℓ+1 is computed in the M-step by maximizing the expectation resulting from this integration, with respect to 𝜃. The resulting maximization problem, dropping from the objective terms that do not depend on 𝜃, is as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_371">L(𝜃; 𝑞 ℓ ) = - 1 2 log det(Σ) - 1 2 ∫︁ 𝐽-1 ∑︁ 𝑗=0 ⃒ ⃒ 𝑣 † 𝑗+1 -Ψ 𝜗 (𝑣 † 𝑗 ) ⃒ ⃒ 2 Σ 𝑞 ℓ (𝑉 † ) 𝑑𝑉 † , (<label>8.4</label></formula><p>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_372">𝜃 ℓ+1 ∈ arg max 𝜃 L(𝜃; 𝑞 ℓ ),</formula><p>emphasizing that 𝑞 ℓ (𝑉 † ) depends on 𝜃 ℓ .</p><p>To illustrate the application of the EM algorithm, in the next Subsection 8.2.1 we discuss a concrete simplified setting: learning only the model error covariance Σ, assuming a known dynamics map Ψ.

The monotonic increase of the likelihood in the population setting does not guarantee that the EM iterations converge.

For this reason, many algorithms used in practice employ either learned priors on the state to facilitate the analysis step, or learned joint distributions on the state and observation, also to facilitate the analysis step.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.5">Bibliography</head><p>In this chapter we have introduced two computational frameworks for joint state and parameter estimation: the EM algorithm and auto-differentiable filters. Both frameworks find the parameters in the dynamical system by approximating the maximum likelihood estimator, and then use a filtering or smoothing algorithm to recover the state. We have focused on learning the dynamics model, but both frameworks directly generalize to learning the observation model; thus, the EM algorithm and auto-differentiable filters can be used not only to learn the prior distribution for the smoothing problem, but also the likelihood function. This final section provides bibliographical context for the algorithms considered in this chapter, and briefly discusses other computational methods that do not stem from a maximum likelihood formulation.</p><p>Embedding of the EnKF and the ensemble Kalman smoother (EnKS) into the EM algorithm was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b431">[411,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b441">421,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b150">130,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b369">349]</ref>, with a focus on estimation of error covariance matrices. The E-step is approximated with an EnKS under the Monte Carlo EM framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b461">[441]</ref>. In addition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[73,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b341">321,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b464">444]</ref> incorporate machine learning techniques in the M-step to train neural network surrogate models or corrections. The paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[62]</ref> proposes Bayesian estimation of model error statistics, together with a neural network emulator for the dynamical system. On the other hand, <ref type="bibr" target="#b442">[422,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b432">412,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b130">110]</ref> consider online EM methods for error covariance estimation with EnKF. Online methods aim to reduce computation by not reprocessing the smoothing distribution for each new observation. Although gradient information is used during the M-step to train the surrogate models in <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[73,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b341">321,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">62]</ref>, these methods do not auto-differentiate through the EnKF.

The paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[104]</ref> considers learning a latent low-dimensional surrogate model for the dynamics and a decoder that maps from the latent space to the state space using auto-differentiable Kalman filters. EnKFs for derivative-free maximum likelihood estimation are studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b420">[400,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b369">349]</ref>. An empirical comparison of the likelihood computed using the EnKF and other filtering algorithms is made in <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[83]</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b215">[195,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b325">305]</ref>. The paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">[131]</ref> uses EnKF likelihood estimates to design a pseudo-marginal MCMC method for Bayesian inference of model parameters. The works <ref type="bibr" target="#b419">[399,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b421">401]</ref> propose online Bayesian parameter estimation using the likelihood computed from the EnKF under a certain family of conjugate distributions.</p><p>While our discussion has focused on ensemble Kalman methods, particle filters can also be employed for joint state and parameter estimation. Particle filters give an unbiased estimate of the data likelihood <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">[123,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">21]</ref>. Based upon this likelihood estimate, a particle MCMC Bayesian parameter estimation method is designed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[21]</ref>. Although particle filter likelihood estimates are unbiased, they suffer from two potential drawbacks that limit their applicability to some problems. First, their variance can be large, as they inherit the weight degeneracy of importance sampling in high dimensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b411">[391,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b392">372,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b395">375]</ref>-see Chapter 6 for further background on this subject. Second, while the forecast and analysis steps of particle filters can be auto-differentiated, the resampling steps involve discrete distributions that cannot be handled by the reparameterization trick, as discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[102]</ref>. For this reason, previous differentiable particle filters omit auto-differentiation of the resampling step <ref type="bibr" target="#b337">[317,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b308">288,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b291">271]</ref>, introducing a bias.</p><p>An alternative to maximum likelihood estimation is to optimize a lower bound of the data log-likelihood with variational inference <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b267">247,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b375">355]</ref>. The posterior distribution over the latent states is approximated with a parametric distribution and is jointly optimized with model parameters defining the stochastic dynamics model. In this direction, variational sequential Monte Carlo methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b337">[317,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b308">288,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b291">271]</ref> construct the lower bound using a particle filter. Moreover, the proposal distribution of the particle filter is parameterized and jointly optimized with model parameters. Although variational sequential Monte Carlo methods provide consistent data log-likelihood estimates, they suffer from the same two potential drawbacks as likelihood-based particle filter methods. A recent work <ref type="bibr" target="#b248">[228]</ref> proposes blending variational sequential Monte Carlo and EnKF with an importance sampling-type lower bound estimate, which is effective if the state dimension is small. Other works that build on the variational inference framework include <ref type="bibr" target="#b275">[255,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b376">356,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b172">152,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b312">292]</ref>. An important challenge is to obtain suitable parameterizations of the posterior, especially when the state dimension is high. For this reason, a restrictive Gaussian parameterization with a diagonal covariance matrix is often used in practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b275">[255,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b172">152]</ref>. The topic of variational approximations to filtering and smoothing problems is discussed in Chapter 7.</p><p>Another alternative approach to maximum likelihood estimation is to concatenate state and parameters into an augmented state-space and employ the data assimilation methods, from other chapters in this Part II, in the augmented state-space. This approach requires one to design a pseudo-dynamic for the parameters, which can be challenging when certain types of parameters (e.g., error covariance matrices) are involved <ref type="bibr" target="#b419">[399,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b145">125]</ref> or if the dimension of the parameters is high. The use of the EnKF for jointly learning the state and model parameters by state augmentation was introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[18]</ref>.</p><p>Beyond the problem of joint parameter and state estimation, the development of data-driven frameworks for learning dynamical systems is a very active research area. We refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b296">[276]</ref> for a framework and to <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[78,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b200">180,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b201">181,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b218">198,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b373">353]</ref> for recent methods that do not rely on the EM algorithm, auto-differentiation of filtering methods, or variational inference. In addition, data-driven machine learning frameworks have gained popularity for combining physics-based models with model error corrections. These hybrid models may avoid the over-smoothing or unphysical behavior of predictive models that replace the entire forecast dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[66]</ref>. Two common representations for model error include additive corrections <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">[143,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">67]</ref> and data-driven subgrid scale parameterizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b377">[357,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">65]</ref>; we refer to Section 1.4 for other forms of model error. We note that the approach discussed in this chapter learns the corrections offline, as online methods typically require the adjoint operator of the physics-based model, which may be challenging to obtain for some physics-based models, e.g., in numerical weather prediction and for climate modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b303">[283]</ref>.</p><p>Model error correction using analysis increments is considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">[118,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b163">143,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">99]</ref>. Alternatively, machine learning can be used to account for model error in data assimilation by learning a mapping between the attractor defined by the model and the attractor of the true system; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[6]</ref> for one approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chapter 9 Transport Perspective On Filters</head><p>This chapter is devoted to the transport perspective on filtering and other related state estimation problems. The methodology is linked, therefore, to Chapter 4 concerning the solution of inverse problems using transport.

We are interested in designing algorithms to learn about 𝑣 † 𝑗 , given all the data observed up to time 𝑗, 𝑌 † 𝑗 . Recall that there are two natural approaches to this problem, probabilistic estimation and state estimation, as discussed in Subsection 6.1.3. In this chapter we will study both approaches, concentrating on estimating the state {𝑣 † 𝑗 }, or on estimating the filtering distribution on the state {𝜋 𝑗 }. In both cases we consider sequential algorithms with respect to 𝑗, and refer to these collectively as filters. The basic idea underlying this chapter is to learn transport algorithms designed to solve these problems. The class of algorithms from which we learn takes the form of mappings from R 𝑑 (or multiple copies thereof) into itself. They are based around the prediction-analysis cycle (6.4); we also briefly consider the modified prediction-analysis structure underlying the optimal particle filter from Subsection 6.3.7.</p><p>We start by formulating a class of state estimation algorithms of the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_409">︀ 𝑣 𝑗+1 = Ψ(𝑣 𝑗 ) + 𝑠𝜉 𝑗 , (<label>9.2a</label></formula><p>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_410">𝑣 𝑗+1 = 𝑇 (︀ ̂︀ 𝑣 𝑗+1 , 𝑦 † 𝑗+1 ; 𝜃 )︀ .

Furthermore P𝜋 EnKF 𝑗 is a Gaussian mixture and the points {̂︀ 𝑣 This measure is invariant under permutations of the ensemble from which it is formed. Motivated by this fact, and extending the same reasoning to the samples on observation space, we highlight that dependence of the map 𝑇 (•) on {̂︀ 𝑣</p><formula xml:id="formula_413">(ℓ) 𝑗+1 , ̂︀ 𝑦 (ℓ)</formula><p>𝑗+1 } 𝑁 ℓ=1 is assumed to be invariant under permutations in index ℓ.

In the second approach, where we choose parameters to learn the filtering distribution rather than just the state, the objective is to choose 𝜃 so that the resulting empirical measure 𝜋 EnKF 𝑗 recovers an approximation of 𝜋 𝑗 .</p><p>We may think of the map 𝑇 as a transport map, as introduced in Section 13.2. This nomenclature is most commonly used in the mathematics literature to describe maps that, through the pushforward operation, map one probability measure into another. We will use this terminology, however, in the context of both state estimation and filtering. We think of the map 𝑇 as transporting states that are predicted by the underlying stochastic dynamics so that they match the data. In Section 9.1 we describe a variety of learning objectives that may be used so that this transport performs well at state estimation; Section 9.2 then deploys these objectives to learn optimal parameters in specific problems classes of the form (9.2) or (9.3), and their generalizations; the ideas are based on using data to learn variants on 3DVar, EnKF and the optimal particle filter. In Section 9.3 we describe various objectives that may be used so that this transport performs well at matching the filtering distribution; Section 9.4 describes algorithm classes that can be learned using these objectives, concentrating on ensemble-based methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.1">State Estimation: Learning Objectives</head><p>This section defines a variety of learning objectives that are relevant for state estimation. We work primarily under the following data assumption concerning a data stream in R 𝑑 × R 𝑘 . Data Assumption 9.1. We have access to data set {𝑣 † 𝑗+1 , 𝑦 † 𝑗+1 } 𝑗∈{0,...,𝐽-1} , generated as a realization of (9.1).</p><p>The filtering algorithms we are studying in this chapter provide a sequential estimate of the state, or the distribution on the state, given a sequence of observations. The preceding assumption, in which we are given data pairs of observations and states, enables us, potentially, to learn good choices of the parameters defining the filters. If the filter is viewed as an architecture that maps 𝑌 † to 𝑉 † , while respecting the casual structure of these sequences in time, then utilizing Data Assumption 9.1 could be viewed as solving a supervised learning problem with only one data pair, a data poor learning environment. However, embedded in the solution to this problem is the learning of a single transport map that uses the observation at each step to perform filtering sequentially. If 𝐽 is large then we may view this as a data rich learning environment for this single transport map.</p><p>For the filters learned using Data Assumption 9.1 to be successful, we assume the model (9.1) generating the data to be a faithful representation of the process that creates the observed data which is utilized after learning. When model error is significant, however, it is natural to use a more restrictive data assumption, namely that we simply have access to an observation sequence. Here, we assume that the observation operator ℎ : R 𝑑 → R 𝑘 that maps states into observations is accurate; however, we do not assume that the stochastic dynamics model is accurate. Data Assumption 9.2. We have access to data set {𝑦 † 𝑗+1 } 𝑗∈{0,...,𝐽-1} , generated as a realization of (9.1).</p><p>In this setting we will use the observation operator ℎ : R 𝑑 → R 𝑘 to map the states into the observation space, to define a loss from which to learn parameters of the filtering algorithm.</p><p>The remainder of this section is organized as follows. Subsection 9.1.1 focuses on state estimation. Subsection 9.1.2 goes beyond this setting by working with scoring rules that compare the distribution defined by an ensemble algorithm with the true state. In both Subsection 9.1.1 and Subsection 9.1.2 we employ Data Assumption 9.1. In Subsection 9.1.3 we discuss objective functions defined in observation space rather than state space; this is useful when model error is significant and we work under Data Assumption 9.2. In Subsection 9.1.4 we assume that our algorithm comes with a covariance estimator, alongside the mean used to estimate the state; we focus on minimizing this covariance, again working with Data Assumption 9.1.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.1.3">Matching The Data</head><p>We now consider the setting in which model (9.1a) is imperfect, i.e., there is model error in the stochastic dynamics model; we assume that the observation model (9.1b) is perfect. In this setting, learning data assimilation algorithms using the methodology from Subsection 9.1.1 may introduce bias because the model generating the data in Data Assumption 9.1 is not the same as the model giving rise to the available observations. Here, instead of (9.7), we consider the following objective function defined in the observation space:</p><formula xml:id="formula_419">J 𝐽 (𝜃) = 1 𝐽 𝐽 ∑︁ 𝑗=1 d (︁ ℎ (︀ 𝑣 𝑗 (𝜃) )︀ , 𝑦 † 𝑗 )︁ .

We note that J 𝐽 (𝜃) is then a proxy for the loss with respect to the true trajectory in the observation space:</p><p>1 <ref type="bibr">.10)</ref> The difference between the two losses is that (9.9) contains observational noise in the observation, which may be substantial. The following remark addresses this issue.</p><formula xml:id="formula_420">𝐽 𝐽 ∑︁ 𝑗=1 d (︁ ℎ (︀ 𝑣 𝑗 (𝜃) )︀ , ℎ(𝑣 † 𝑗 ) )︁ . (<label>9</label></formula><p>Remark 9.5. Optimizing the cost function J 𝐽 (𝜃) in (9.9) does not always lead to good performance. The root cause is that the objective function can overfit to the specific observations, which contain unknown observational errors. For example, if ℎ is uniquely invertible then a perfect score can be achieved by simply setting 𝑣 𝑗 (𝜃) = ℎ -1 (𝑦 † 𝑗 ). When the signal-to-noise ratio is small, this will lead to a very noisy estimate 𝑣 𝑗 (𝜃) of the signal. If only a single realization of the observed process is available, then this is a fundamental obstacle. However, if it is possible to obtain multiple independent realizations, then the overfitting issue can be mitigated. In this setting, we describe a method based on this observation to avoid overfitting. We take the squared Euclidean distance d(𝑢 1 , 𝑢 2 ) = |𝑢 1 -𝑢 2 | 2 as the scoring rule and analyze a single time 𝑗. Similar analyses could be performed for other scoring rules and multiple times.</p><p>Recall that 𝑦 † 𝑗 = ℎ(𝑣 † 𝑗 ) + 𝜂 † 𝑗 . Note that the data assimilation algorithm produces an estimator 𝑣 𝑗 (𝜃) for 𝑣 † 𝑗 which will depend on 𝑦 † 𝑗 and hence on 𝜂 † 𝑗 .

(9.11)</formula><p>Minimizing the left-hand side is desirable as it matches the output of the analysis, 𝑣 𝑗 (𝜃), with the true signal, 𝑣 † 𝑗 ; note that it does not depend on the observational noise explicitly, only through the dependence of 𝑣 𝑗 (𝜃) on the data. The right-hand side can be approximated through sampling the observational noise 𝜂 † 𝑗 , and then optimized over 𝜃 to approximately minimize the left-hand side. The natural setting in which the idea explained here may be used is when Data Assumption 9.2 is generalized to multiple realizations of an observation stream defined over 𝑗 ∈ {1, . . . , 𝐽}. 1  ♢</p></div>

We concentrate on particle-based methods. Recall that the time evolution of the filtering distribution can be defined by interweaving prediction by the underling stochastic dynamics with Bayes Theorem to incorporate the observations via the analysis step-see Section 6.3. In particular, (6.4) defines the evolution via the (i) prediction 𝜋 𝑗 ↦ → ̂︀ 𝜋 𝑗+1 = P𝜋 𝑗 and the (ii) analysis ̂︀ 𝜋 𝑗+1 ↦ → 𝜋 𝑗+1 = A 𝑗 (̂︀ 𝜋 𝑗+1 ) steps; it is in step (ii) that the data 𝑦 † 𝑗+1 is incorporated. The bootstrap particle filter of Subsection 6.3.6 uses this factorization of the filter evolution. This can be summarized, similarly to Section 6.3, as</p><formula xml:id="formula_459">𝜋 𝑗+1 = A 𝑗 ∘ P𝜋 𝑗 .</formula><p>The optimal particle filter (OPF) of Subsection 6.3.7 uses a different factorization into (i) 𝜋 𝑗 ↦ → p 𝑗+1 and (ii) p 𝑗+1 ↦ → 𝜋 𝑗+1 , in which both steps depends on the data 𝑦 † 𝑗+1 . At each time step 𝑗, the OPF first applies an analysis step to sample the conditional distribution p 𝑗+1 := P(𝑣 𝑗 |𝑌 𝑗 , 𝑦 † 𝑗+1 ) starting from P(𝑣 𝑗 |𝑌 𝑗 ); and second it applies a prediction step to sample from P(𝑣 𝑗+1 |𝑌 𝑗 , 𝑦 † 𝑗+1 ). These two steps may be summarized using the relationship</p><formula xml:id="formula_460">𝜋 𝑗+1 = P OPF 𝑗 ∘ A OPF 𝑗 𝜋 𝑗 .</formula><p>While the OPF performs the analysis step using importance sampling, we will show in this section how to achieve the first step using transports. In particular, our goal is to find a map 𝑇 depending on some parameters 𝜃 so that</p><formula xml:id="formula_461">𝑇 (𝑣 𝑗 , 𝑦 † 𝑗+1 ; 𝜃) ∼ A OPF 𝑗 𝜋 𝑗 , 𝑣 𝑗 ∼ 𝜋 𝑗 .

Indeed it is instructive to think of scoring rules as being introduced for this purpose: metrics and divergences may not be amenable to measuring distance between two probability measures when both are given only through samples, and are hence a sum of Dirac measures. Subsection 9.3.3 focuses on learning objectives appropriate for ensemble algorithms of the form (9.3): prediction using P and learning an approximation of the analysis map A 𝑗 , using a transport.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.4.2">General Transport Map</head><p>We start by discussing the learning of a transport map using the methodology outlined in Subsection 9.3.3. Using algorithm class (9.29) and noting Remark 9.15, forms a natural setting for which we wish to learn parameter 𝜃 under Data Assumption 9.12.</p><p>A major challenge for learning within ensemble filtering algorithm classes is that both the reference (prediction) and target (analysis) distributions for the map do not have analytical density functions; everything is defined through approximate ensembles, and hence combinations of Dirac measures.

Remark 11.26 highlights the fact that both MMD and the energy distance can be implemented when both probability measures are sums of Dirac measures. In this subsection we use the energy distance for ease of notation, while the following subsection will be implemented with the (more general) MMD. Recall from Definition 11.24 the squared energy distance, here expressed in terms of matching measures ̂︀ 𝜋, 𝜋 through a pushforward 𝑇 :</p><formula xml:id="formula_480">D 2 E (𝑇 ♯ ̂︀ 𝜋, 𝜋) = 2E (𝑣,𝑣 ′ )∼𝑇 ♯ ̂︀ 𝜋⊗𝜋 |𝑣 -𝑣 ′ | -E (𝑣,𝑣 ′ )∼𝑇 ♯ ̂︀ 𝜋⊗𝑇 ♯ ̂︀ 𝜋 |𝑣 -𝑣 ′ | -E (𝑣,𝑣 ′ )∼𝜋⊗𝜋 |𝑣 -𝑣 ′ |.

While evaluating the loss function, and hence the learned transport map, relies on importance sampling, the forecast ensemble will be updated using the transport alone. The transport will push-forward an equally weighted ensemble of forecast to analysis samples. This may partially alleviate the degeneracy faced by particle filters where the ensemble eventually has an effective sample size of 1. Particle degeneracy arises from keeping the position of each particle fixed during the analysis step. This constraint forces particles to possibly remain in regions of low probability under the filtering distribution, after conditioning on an observation. Instead, the approach outlined in this section uses transport to move the particle positions in each analysis step. ♢</p></div>

We show how several learning problems for classical algorithms, such as learning the parameters in an EnKF can be viewed as parameterizing a transport map, and generalize the classical algorithm based on a constant gain function. This perspective permits generalizations of the methodology to new architectures and loss functions to identify optimal parameters in these methods from data, such as the use of probabilistic losses that aim to match the true filtering distribution. Whilst some algorithms have already been implemented and tested, demonstrating favourable behaviour, it is of interest to examine the performance of variants proposed here, such as the OPF with learned parameters, which have not yet been tested. In this section, we provide some relevant references to existing numerical methods and relevant techniques.</p><p>Learning approaches for ensemble filtering and smoothing based on transportation of measure have shown recent promise in generalizing classic Kalman approaches and reducing the error.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chapter 10 Data Dependence Of Filters And Smoothers</head><p>In this chapter we use learning to solve the filtering and smoothing problems introduced in Chapter 6. We consider both state estimation, i.e., finding a representative sequence of states from the observations and knowledge of the model, and probabilistic estimation, i.e., approximating the posterior distributions for sequences of states given observations. Doing this, of course, was also the subject of Chapters 7 and 9. The key distinguishing concept in this chapter is amortization: the idea that, if we learn dependence of an algorithm on data it may be re-used multiple times and hence the investment cost in the original training of the method is amortized; the success of such an approach depends on the ability of the proposed method to learn data dependence that generalizes well. Recall that the idea of learning based on observing multiple instances of data was introduced in Sections 5.1-5.2 in the context of learning regularizers for general inverse problems and in Sections 5.3-5.5 in the context of approximations to the posterior distribution arising from Bayesian inversion based on transport. Furthermore, we note that in Chapter 9 we have also learned models that take different observation sequences as input; there we use long time-trajectories and ergodicity, coupled with inductive bias in the form of the learned filters, to address the issue of learning dependence on different observation sequences.</p><p>In this chapter our approach is more akin to Chapter 5, using multiple data sets, rather than one long trajectory and the appeal to ergodicity. We focus on learning data dependence for filtering and smoothing algorithms. Section 10.1 is devoted to state estimation, and to learning data-dependence in 3DVar and 4DVar-type algorithms, respectively. In Section 10.2 we study variational approaches from Chapter 7, showing how to introduce amortization in both filtering and smoothing approaches. Section 10.3 is devoted to transport-based methods, from Chapter 9, generalizing them to the amortized setting; a transport methodology for learning ensemble filters is introduced that employs objective functions based on the energy distance or maximum likelihood estimation. We include a concrete example of learning transports for smoothing, again employing the energy distance. In Section 10.4 we introduce a new learning paradigm for amortized data assimilation problems, based on strictly proper scoring rules. The chapter concludes with bibliographic remarks in Section 10.5. Throughout, we use the notational conventions summarized in Remark 7.1. We recommend that the reader review this notation.</p></div>

We work with probability measures on R 𝑑 , denoted 𝒫(R 𝑑 ).</p><p>To be consistent with the rest of the notes, the presentation focuses mainly on probability density functions; but the definitions can all be extended to general probability measures. Indeed we will employ Dirac measures in several instances. We start with metrics in Section 11.1; we continue with divergences in Section 11.2; and finally we consider scoring rules in Section 11.3. Throughout the chapter we will make connections between metrics, divergences and scoring rules; these connections are summarized in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_68">11</ref>.1.</p><p>Our motivation for studying this topic is twofold. First, some metrics and divergences provide a language in which to state theoretical results about inverse problems and data assimilation. Second, others are used to define loss functions for probabilistic machine learning models based on data, and to design and assess the convergence of machine learning algorithms. As an example of the first motivation, the Hellinger distance is useful for stating stability results for measures; see, for instance, Theorems 1.18 and 1.27. As an example of the second, the energy distance is a metric that is used as a loss function for tasks such as learning probabilistic filters; see Section 9.3. The Kullback-Leibler divergence is useful both for stating theoretical results for inverse problems and data assimilation (see discussion in bibliography Section 1.6) and for defining loss functions in machine learning (see Chapter 4). Scoring rules have been used traditionally for evaluating probabilistic forecasts against samples and hold potential to define objectives for machine learning tasks.</p><p>When comparing two probability density functions in this chapter we will generically denote them by 𝜌 and 𝜚.

Consider the setting where 𝜌 and 𝜚 are probability density functions. Then the Hellinger distance between 𝜌 and 𝜚 is equal to one if and only if the measures have disjoint supports. This follows from (11.1): the Hellinger distance is 1 if and only if √ 𝜌 √ 𝜚 = 0 in a Lebesgue a.e. sense, since the square-roots of the densities are non-negative functions; this implies that their supports must be disjoint. A similar result holds for total variation distance. Care is needed in stating such results between measures that include atoms, as this makes arguments which apply Lebesgue a.e. redundant; the Example 11.4 demonstrates this. ♢ 11.1.3 Transportation Metrics We start by defining the notions of coupling and transport map. Definition 11.6. Let 𝜌 and 𝜚 be two probability densities on R 𝑑 . A coupling of 𝜌 and 𝜚 is a probability density function 𝜋 on R 𝑑 × R 𝑑 with the property that ∫︁ R 𝑑 𝜋(𝑧, 𝑢) 𝑑𝑢 = 𝜌(𝑧), ∫︁ R 𝑑</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>𝜋(𝑧, 𝑢) 𝑑𝑧 = 𝜚(𝑢);</head><p>thus the 𝑧 and 𝑢 marginals of 𝜋 deliver 𝜌 and 𝜚 respectively. We denote the set of all such couplings by Π 𝜌,𝜚 . ♢ Definition 11.7. Let 𝜌 and 𝜚 be two probability densities on R 𝑑 . A transport map 𝑔 : R 𝑑 → R 𝑑 between 𝜌 and 𝜚 is a map with the property that 𝜚 = 𝑔 ♯ 𝜌. ♢</p><p>We now link these two concepts through two distinct formulations of optimal transport.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Kantorovich Formulation</head><p>Given a cost function c : R 𝑑 × R 𝑑 → R + we define the Kantorovich formulation of the optimal transport problem as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_557">𝜋 ⋆ = arginf 𝜋∈Π𝜌,𝜚 ∫︁ R 𝑑 ×R 𝑑 c(𝑧, 𝑢)𝜋(𝑧, 𝑢) 𝑑𝑧𝑑𝑢.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Metrics From Optimal Transport</head><p>The notion of optimal transport may be used to define families of probability metrics by choosing the cost function in the Kantorovich formulation of optimal transport to be a power of a metric on R 𝑑 .</p><p>Definition 11.8. Given a metric d(•, •) on R 𝑑 and 𝑝 ≥ 1, the Wasserstein-𝑝 distance between two probability density functions 𝜌 and 𝜚 is defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_560">𝑊 𝑝 (𝜌, 𝜚) := (︂ inf 𝜋∈Π𝜌,𝜚 ∫︁ R 𝑑 ×R 𝑑 d(𝑧, 𝑢) 𝑝 𝜋(𝑧, 𝑢) 𝑑𝑧𝑑𝑢 )︂ 1/𝑝 .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>♢</head><p>This probability metric has two key aspects: first, it is a metric on 𝒫(R 𝑑 ) that relates to an underlying metric on R 𝑑 ; and second, it allows for a meaningful distance to be calculated between measures which are mutually singular. </p><formula xml:id="formula_561">𝑊 2 (𝜌, 𝜚) 2 = |𝑚 𝜌 -𝑚 𝜚 | 2 + Tr (︁ Σ 𝜌 + Σ 𝜚 -2 (︀ Σ 1/2 𝜌 Σ 𝜚 Σ 1/2 𝜌 )︀ 1/2 )︁ .</formula><p>In particular, if 𝜚 is a Dirac measure at 𝑚 𝜚 then</p><formula xml:id="formula_562">𝑊 2 (𝜌, 𝜚) 2 = |𝑚 𝜌 -𝑚 𝜚 | 2 + Tr (︀ Σ 𝜌 )︀ .</formula><p>Thus, in the Wasserstein-2 distance, Gaussian 𝜌 is close to a Dirac at 𝑚 𝜚 if the mean of the Gaussian 𝜌 is close to 𝑚 𝜚 and if its covariance is small. In contrast, <ref type="bibr">Example 11.4</ref> shows that the total variation distance between Gaussian 𝜌 and a Dirac at 𝑚 𝜚 is maximal, and equal to</p><p>1, unless the two measures coincide (𝑚 𝜌 = 𝑚 𝜚 , Σ 𝜌 = 0) in which case it is 0. Notice also that if 𝜌 and 𝜚 are Diracs at 𝑚 𝜌 and 𝑚 𝜚 , then 𝑊 2 (𝜌, 𝜚) = |𝑚 𝜌 -𝑚 𝜚 |; thus closeness of the mass locations 𝑚 𝜌 and 𝑚 𝜚 in Euclidean space translates into closeness of 𝜌 and 𝜚 in Wasserstein distance. Again, Example 11.4 shows that two Diracs are maximally far apart in the total variation distance unless they coincide. ♢ One-Dimensional Setting</p><p>Optimal transport metrics have as an advantage that they directly link a metric on R 𝑑 to the metric on 𝒫(R 𝑑 ). However it is an implicit definition, via an optimization.

The map 𝑔(𝑧) = 𝐹 -1 𝜚 ∘ 𝐹 𝜌 (𝑧) pushes forward 𝜌 to 𝜚, and it can be shown to lead to the optimal Kantorovich coupling in the one-dimensional setting; this follows from the Monge formulation as detailed in the bibliography Section 11.4. By substituting this map in the objective and performing the change of variables 𝑞 = 𝐹 𝜌 (𝑧), we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_564">𝑊 𝑝 (𝜌, 𝜚) 𝑝 = inf 𝑔 ♯ 𝜌=𝜚 ∫︁ R |𝑧 -𝑔(𝑧)| 𝑝 𝜌(𝑧) 𝑑𝑧 = ∫︁ R |𝑧 -𝐹 -1 𝜚 ∘ 𝐹 𝜌 (𝑧)| 𝑝 𝜌(𝑧) 𝑑𝑧 = ∫︁ 1 0 |𝐹 -1 𝜌 (𝑞) -𝐹 -1 𝜚 (𝑞)| 𝑝 𝑑𝑞.</formula><p>The Wasserstein-𝑝 distance for 𝑝 = 1 has some additional computational advantages. It is an IPM, as discussed in Example 11.15. Furthermore, the closed-form expression in one dimension can be rewritten without requiring the inverse of cumulative distribution functions: Lemma 11.11. In the setting of Lemma 11.10, the Wasserstein-1 distance can be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_565">𝑊 1 (𝜌, 𝜚) = ∫︁ 1 0 |𝐹 -1 𝜌 (𝑞) -𝐹 -1 𝜚 (𝑞)| 𝑑𝑞 = ∫︁ R |𝐹 𝜌 (𝑧) -𝐹 𝜚 (𝑧)| 𝑑𝑧.</formula><p>Proof.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supervised Learning</head><p>This chapter is concerned with the supervised learning task of approximating, from data, a function 𝜓 † : 𝐷 → 𝑅, 𝐷 the domain and 𝑅 the range. Supervised learning refers specifically to learning 𝜓 † from data given in the form of input-output pairs of 𝜓 † . In this chapter we focus on the regression problem in which the domain 𝐷 ⊆ R 𝑑 and range 𝑅 ⊆ R are uncountable subsets of R 𝑑 and R, respectively; the methods we introduce are readily generalized to the case 𝑅 ⊆ R 𝑚 for any integer 𝑚. When the range of 𝜓 † has finite cardinality we refer to the function approximation problem as classification. Classification played a central role in the historical development of supervised learning, and is still one of its major uses. We, however, focus on regression: this is a task that arises naturally in the context of learning forward maps for inverse problems and learning dynamical systems for data assimilation; in particular learning emulators. Our data assumption is as follows: Data Assumption 12.1. Let 𝐷 ⊆ R 𝑑 , 𝑅 ⊆ R and 𝜓 † : 𝐷 → 𝑅. Let {𝜉 (𝑛) } 𝑁 𝑛=1 be i.i.d. drawn from a mean zero noise process taking values in R and let 𝜆 ≥ 0. Data is available in the form {︁ 𝑢 (𝑛) , 𝑦 (𝑛)   }︁ 𝑁 𝑛=1 , 𝑦 (𝑛) = 𝜓 † (𝑢 (𝑛) ) + √ 𝜆𝜉 (𝑛) , <ref type="bibr">(12.1)</ref> where the {𝑢 (𝑛) } 𝑁 𝑛=1 are generated i.i.d. from probability density function ϒ(𝑢), supported on 𝐷, and independently of the draws from the noise process.</p><p>The parameter 𝜆 ≥ 0 allows us to consider noiseless data (𝜆 = 0) and noisy data (𝜆 &gt; 0). Since the goal is to determine 𝜓 † we are concerned with function approximation, and to that end we will study three approaches to parameterize and learn functions: neural networks (Section 12.2), random features (Section 12.3), and Gaussian processes (Section 12.4). We will concentrate on the noiseless case 𝜆 = 0, but will briefly mention the noisy case 𝜆 &gt; 0 in the context of random features and Gaussian processes. Before considering these methods of function approximation we introduce some notational conventions that will be useful in this and the following chapter.</p><p>12.1 Notational Conventions Definition 12.2. We let 𝐻 ϒ denote the Hilbert space of real-valued functions on 𝐷 with inner-product and induced norm ⟨𝜓, 𝜙⟩ 𝐻 ϒ = ∫︁ 𝐷 𝜓(𝑢)𝜙(𝑢)ϒ(𝑢) 𝑑𝑢, |𝜓| 2 𝐻 ϒ = ⟨𝜓, 𝜓⟩ 𝐻 ϒ . ♢ Thus the induced norm on 𝐻 ϒ is given more explicitly by |𝜓| 𝐻 ϒ = (︂∫︁ 𝐷 𝜓(𝑢) 2 ϒ(𝑢) 𝑑𝑢 )︂ 1/2 . (12.2) Definition 12.3. Given the data from Data Assumption 12.1 we define the empirical density</p><formula xml:id="formula_665">ϒ 𝑁 (𝑢) = 1 𝑁 𝑁 ∑︁ 𝑛=1 𝛿(𝑢 -𝑢 (𝑛)</formula><p>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="12.2">Neural Networks</head><p>We define neural networks acting as real-valued maps on finite dimensional Euclidean space. For simplicity we work, throughout this section, under Data Assumption 12.1, considering only the noise-free setting 𝜆 = 0. To define a neural network we first define: The Exponential Linear Unit (ELU) activation function is obtained from the SELU by setting 𝜅 = 1. ♢</p><p>A neural network is a parametric family of functions found by composing activation functions with affine functions. We introduce Θ ⊆ R 𝑑 𝜃 and then 𝜓 : R 𝑑 × Θ → R via the iteration 𝜓 0 (𝑢; 𝜃) = 𝑢, <ref type="bibr">(12.4</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_667">𝜓 (ℓ+1) (𝑢; 𝜃) = 𝜎 (︀ 𝑊 ℓ 𝜓 (ℓ) (𝑢; 𝜃) + 𝑏 ℓ )︀</formula><p>, ℓ = 0, . . . , 𝐿 -1, (12.5) 𝜓(𝑢; 𝜃) = 𝛽 ⊤ 𝜓 (𝐿) (𝑢; 𝜃), <ref type="bibr">(12.6)</ref> where, for ℓ ∈ {0, . . . , 𝐿 -1}, 𝑊 ℓ ∈ R 𝑑 ℓ+1 ×𝑑 ℓ and 𝑏 ℓ ∈ R 𝑑 ℓ+1 , with 𝑑 0 = 𝑑 and 𝛽 ∈ R 𝑑 𝐿 ; together the matrices {𝑊 ℓ } 𝐿-<ref type="foot" target="#foot_14">foot_14</ref> ℓ=0 and vectors {𝑏 ℓ } 𝐿-1 ℓ=0 define 𝜃 (and 𝑑 𝜃 ). Indeed here we define 𝜗 = {𝑊 ℓ , 𝑏 ℓ } 𝐿-1 ℓ=0 and 𝜃 = (𝜗, 𝛽). Note that 𝜓 (ℓ) : R 𝑑 × Θ → R 𝑑 ℓ . Resulting function 𝜓 : R 𝑑 × Θ → R is known as a (deep 1 ) neural network. The reader will note that the concept is readily generalized to 𝜓 : R 𝑑 × Θ → R 𝑞 for any integer 𝑞; we concentrate on 𝑞 = 1 for simplicity of exposition only.</p><p>By use of the data, a value of the parameter defining the affine functions may be chosen so as to determine an approximation of 𝜓 † .

What we do have access to is the data set in Data Assumption 12.1 which contains implicit information about both ϒ and 𝜓 † . Thus the optimal parameter 𝜃 ⋆ is chosen to minimize the empirical risk</p><formula xml:id="formula_670">J 𝑁 (𝜃) := |𝜓 † -𝜓(•; 𝜃)| 2 𝐻 ϒ N .</formula><p>Notice that, since we have assumed that 𝜆 = 0,</p><formula xml:id="formula_671">J 𝑁 (𝜃) = 1 𝑁 𝑁 ∑︁ 𝑛=1 |𝑦 (𝑛) -𝜓(𝑢 (𝑛) ; 𝜃)| 2 .</formula><p>(12.9)</p><p>Remark 12.6. We have derived this loss function J 𝑁 (•) under Data Assumption 12.1 with 𝜆 = 0. However it may also be derived under the more general assumption that data set (𝑢 (𝑛) , 𝑦 (𝑛) ) is drawn i.i.d. from a probability measure 𝜋 on 𝒫(R 𝑑 × R 𝑘 ). Examples of such measures may be found from Data Assumption 12.1 for any 𝜆 ≥ 0, but the setting is much more general. The risk may then be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_672">J(𝜃) := E (𝑢,𝑦)∼𝜋 |𝑦 -𝜓(𝑢; 𝜃)| 2</formula><p>and approximated empirically to again obtain (12.9). ♢ Minimizing (12.9) leads to an implementable strategy for function approximation. The empirical risk is typically non-convex as a function of 𝜃, with multiple saddle points and local minima. Robust software to perform the minimization via the use of stochastic gradient descent (Chapter 15) is readily available. Once 𝜃 ⋆ is obtained (typically an approximation of the global minimizer), we write 𝜓 ⋆ (𝑢) := 𝜓(𝑢; 𝜃 ⋆ ).</p><p>Remark 12.7. We derived (12.9) by approximating (12.7) empirically. If the objective functional J(•) in (12.7) is viewed as a function of 𝜓, rather than 𝜃, then we say that the optimization problem is non-parametric. It is interesting to note that this problem is convex in 𝜓. This fact is often used to motivate the empirical observation that the parametric optimization problem (12.9) becomes simpler when over-parameterized. ♢</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="12.3">Random Features</head><p>In this section we introduce the idea of approximation by random features, and in so doing we make a link between neural networks and Gaussian processes, the objects of study (respectively) in the preceding and following sections. We continue to work under Data Assumption 12.1 in the setting 𝜆 = 0. To motivate our eventual formulation of random features, we consider a thought experiment in which we again use the class of functions defined by the neural networks <ref type="bibr">(12.4)</ref>. Now, rather than optimizing over all of Θ, the parameters 𝜗 = {𝑊 ℓ , 𝑏 ℓ } 𝐿-1 ℓ=0 are fixed and optimization is performed only over 𝛽 ∈ R 𝑑 𝐿 . Note that 𝜓 (𝐿) depends only on 𝜗 and not 𝛽. Thus we modify notation and write 𝜓 (𝐿) (•; 𝜗) : R 𝑑 → R 𝑑 𝐿 . We then define 𝜙 𝑖 (•; 𝜗) : R 𝑑 → R to be the 𝑖 𝑡ℎ component, for 𝑖 = 1, . . . , 𝑑 𝐿 , of the vector-valued output function 𝜓 (𝐿) (•; 𝜗). We can then write 𝜓(𝑢; 𝜗, 𝛽) := 𝑑 𝐿 ∑︁ 𝑖=1 𝛽 𝑖 𝜙 𝑖 (𝑢; 𝜗), (12.10) viewing 𝜓(•; 𝜗, 𝛽) as parameterized by 𝛽, since the remaining elements 𝜗 of 𝜃 have been fixed. From 𝜓 † we may define 𝛽 ⋆ ∈ arg min 𝛽∈R 𝑑 𝐿 |𝜓 † -𝜓(•; 𝜗, 𝛽)| 2 𝐻 ϒ N = arg min 𝛽∈R 𝑑 𝐿 𝑁 ∑︁ 𝑛=1 |𝑦 (𝑛) -𝜓(𝑢 (𝑛) ; 𝜗, 𝛽)| 2</p><p>and 𝜓 ⋆ (𝑢) := 𝜓(𝑢; 𝜗, 𝛽 ⋆ ). In contrast to full optimization over 𝜃, this leads to a convex, indeed quadratic, optimization problem that can be readily solved. So far we have simply fixed 𝜗; we have not discussed how to choose it. One natural approach is to simply pick 𝜗 at random from some probability measure. The idea behind this is that, if 𝑑 𝐿 is large, the collection of random functions {𝜙 𝑖 (•; 𝜗)} 𝑑 𝐿 𝑖=1 may be sufficiently expressive for the function approximation task at hand; whether or not it is sufficiently expressive will depend on the parameterization of 𝜙(•; 𝜗) and on the support and distribution of the probability measure from which 𝜗 is drawn. With our current construction, the resulting collection of functions {𝜙 𝑖 } 𝑑 𝐿 𝑖 are then random but not, in general, i.i.d. It is intuitive that, given 𝑑 𝐿 , working with an i.i.d. set of random functions will be more efficient and so we discuss a variant on the preceding construction that enforces the i.i.d. property on the {𝜙 𝑖 } 𝑑 𝐿 𝑖 . To realize this construction we consider 𝑞 ∈ 𝒫(R 𝑑 𝜗 ) and define 𝜙 : R 𝑑 × R 𝑑 𝜗 → R. We then set 𝜓(𝑢; 𝛽) := 𝑑 𝐿 ∑︁ 𝑖=1 𝛽 𝑖 𝜙(𝑢; 𝜗 𝑖 ), 𝜗 𝑖 ∼ 𝑞, i.i.d. <ref type="bibr">(12.11)</ref> We may again employ empirical risk minimization to determine vector 𝛽 in <ref type="bibr">(12.11)</ref>. To this end we introduce a regularized quadratic loss function and then 𝛽 ⋆ is defined via</p><formula xml:id="formula_673">𝛽 ⋆ ∈ arg min 𝛽∈R 𝑑 𝐿</formula><p>J 𝑁,reg (𝛽), (12.12a)</p><formula xml:id="formula_674">J 𝑁,reg (𝛽) := 1 2 𝑁 ∑︁ 𝑛=1 |𝑦 (𝑛) -𝜓(𝑢 (𝑛) ; 𝛽)| 2 + 𝜆 reg 2 |𝛽| 2 . (12.12b)</formula><p>Here 𝜆 reg &gt; 0 is the regularization parameter. The regularization is quadratic and hence does not change the simplicity of the optimization problem for 𝛽 : it still results in solution of a linear system. Furthermore the specific regularization arises naturally in the context of noisy data 𝜉 (𝑛) ∼ 𝒩 (0, 𝐼) in (12.1) -see Remark 12.13. Finally we observe that, since 𝜆 reg &gt; 0, the system of linear equations is guaranteed to have a unique solution. This we now prove.</p><p>Theorem 12.8. Assume that 𝜆 reg &gt; 0. Then the linear system for 𝛽 defined by the optimization problem (12.12) takes the form 𝐵𝛽 = 𝑟 where 𝐵 is strictly positive-definite. Proof. Recall empirical meausre ϒ 𝑁 from Definition 12.3. The (𝑖, 𝑗) entry of matrix 𝐵 has the form 𝐵 𝑖𝑗 = 𝑁 E 𝑢∼ϒ 𝑁 𝜙(𝑢; 𝜗 𝑖 )𝜙(𝑢; 𝜗 𝑗 ) + 𝜆 reg 𝛿 𝑖𝑗 , where 𝛿 𝑖𝑗 is the Kronecker delta. For each 𝑢 ∈ R 𝑑 define 𝜙(𝑢) ∈ R 𝑑 𝐿 to be the vector with 𝑖 𝑡ℎ entry 𝜙(𝑢; 𝜗 𝑖 ). From this it follows that</p><formula xml:id="formula_675">⟨𝑧, 𝐵𝑧⟩ R 𝑑 𝐿 = 𝑁 E 𝑢∼ϒ 𝑁 |⟨𝜙(𝑢), 𝑧⟩ R 𝑑 𝐿 | 2 + 𝜆 reg |𝑧| 2 R 𝑑 𝐿 ≥ 𝜆 reg |𝑧| 2 R 𝑑 𝐿 .</formula><p>Thus symmetric matrix 𝐵 is strictly positive definite since we have shown that all eigenvalues are bounded below by 𝜆 reg &gt; 0.</p><p>We refer to the functions 𝜙(•; 𝜗), with 𝜗 ∼ 𝑞 i.i.d., as random features. Similarly to before we may write 𝜓 ⋆ (𝑢) := 𝜓(𝑢; 𝛽 ⋆ ). where 𝜗 = (𝜔, 𝑏) is chosen at random. It is natural to take 𝑏 ∼ 𝑈 [0, 2𝜋], and we assume 𝜔 ∼ 𝑊, for some 𝑊 ∈ 𝒫(R 𝑑 ). ♢ Example 12.10. Each 𝜙(•; 𝜗 𝑖 ) may be chosen as a neural network, for example, with the parameters of that neural network chosen i.i.d. at random from given distribution 𝑞. ♢</p><p>The spatial correlation in the random features is a natural object to study; indeed we will see that it leads to a connection between random features and Gaussian process regression. To this end, we introduce kernel (recall Definition 11.17)</p><formula xml:id="formula_676">𝑐(𝑢, 𝑢 ′ ) := E 𝑞 [︀ 𝜙(𝑢; 𝜗)𝜙(𝑢 ′ ; 𝜗) ]︀ , (<label>12.13)</label></formula><p>where expectation is over 𝜗 ∼ 𝑞.</p><p>Example 12.11. Consider Example 12.9. We note that</p><formula xml:id="formula_677">𝑐(𝑢, 𝑢 ′ ) = ∫︁ R 𝑑 𝐼(𝜔)𝑊 (𝜔) 𝑑𝜔, 𝐼(𝜔) = 1 2𝜋 ∫︁ 2𝜋 0 cos (︀ ⟨𝜔, 𝑢⟩ + 𝑏 )︀ cos (︀ ⟨𝜔, 𝑢 ′ ⟩ + 𝑏 )︀ 𝑑𝑏 = 1 2 cos (︀ ⟨𝜔, 𝑢 -𝑢 ′ ⟩ )︀</formula><p>.</p><p>Thus the resulting kernel depends only on 𝑢 -𝑢 ′ : 𝑐(𝑢, 𝑢 ′ ) = c(𝑢 -𝑢 ′ ) for some c : R → R.</p><p>We say that the random feature is stationary. ♢</p></div>

In this subsection we show, under mild assumptions, an explicit construction of the RKHS associated with the covariance function of a Gaussian process on a compact domain. In the following Subsection 12.4.2 we formulate and study Gaussian process regression in this RKHS.</p><p>Let 𝐷 ⊂ R 𝑑 be compact and let 𝑐 be a symmetric, non-negative definite and continuous kernel, interpreted as the covariance function of a Gaussian process. The integral operator 𝒞 : 𝐿 2 (𝐷) → 𝐿 2 (𝐷) given by (𝒞𝜙)(𝑢) = ∫︁ 𝐷 𝑐(𝑢, 𝑢 ′ )𝜙(𝑢 ′ ) 𝑑𝑢 ′ , 𝜙 ∈ 𝐿 2 (𝐷), <ref type="bibr">(12.14)</ref> is called the covariance operator with kernel 𝑐.

Furthermore, Mercer's theorem (see the bibliography Section 12.6) ensures that the eigenfunctions corresponding to non-zero eigenvalues are continuous on 𝐷 (which implies that pointwise evaluations are well defined) and that the covariance function can be represented using the eigenpairs of 𝒞 as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_678">𝑐(𝑢, 𝑢 ′ ) = ∞ ∑︁ 𝑖=1 𝜎 𝑖 𝜙 𝑖 (𝑢)𝜙 𝑖 (𝑢 ′ ),</formula><p>𝑢, 𝑢 ′ ∈ 𝐷, <ref type="bibr">(12.15)</ref> where the convergence is absolute and uniform.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chapter 13 Unsupervised Learning And Generative Modeling</head><p>This chapter is concerned with the subject of unsupervised learning. The following data assumption is made:</p><formula xml:id="formula_695">Data Assumption 13.1.</formula><p>We have available data in the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_696">𝑈 := {𝑢 (𝑛) } 𝑁 𝑛=1 , (<label>13.1)</label></formula><p>assumed to be drawn i.i.d. from (unknown) probability density function ϒ on R 𝑑 .</p><p>This should be compared with the supervised learning Data Assumption 12.1 (or the generalization discussed in Remark 12.6), where we are given input-output pairs, linked through an unknown function. In this chapter, through the Data Assumption 13.1, we have access to the empirical density (see Definition 12.3)</p><formula xml:id="formula_697">ϒ 𝑁 (𝑢) = 1 𝑁 𝑁 ∑︁ 𝑛=1 𝛿 𝑢 (𝑛) (𝑢). (13.</formula><p>2)</p><p>The goal is to understand the data set summarized by measure ϒ 𝑁 . One widely used approach is to study clustering within the data; we will not pursue this important topic because it is not of direct relevance to the solution of inverse problems and data assimilation, our focus in these notes. Instead we pursue the approach of generative modeling: we try and create new samples from ϒ, given ϒ 𝑁 . We illustrate the idea of generative modeling with two examples.</p><p>Example 13.2. A natural starting point for generative modeling is to discuss density estimation. This methodology seeks to approximate ϒ(𝑢), from within some class of densities, on the basis of the data summarized in ϒ 𝑁 (𝑢). The goal is not always generative modeling: it may be to have a smooth density which can be differentiated or otherwise manipulated in a way that ϒ 𝑁 (𝑢) cannot. However, some classes of approximate ϒ can be used to generate new samples. An example is when the approximation is a Gaussian mixture. ♢ Example 13.3. We introduce the measure transport task of determining function 𝑔 : R 𝑑𝑧 → R 𝑑 so that, given probability density function 𝜁 on R 𝑑𝑧 and probability density function ϒ on R 𝑑 , 𝑔 ♯ 𝜁 = ϒ; here 𝑔 ♯ denotes the pushforward operation 1 and so, explicitly, we are seeking 𝑔 so that, if 𝑧 ∼ 𝜁, then 𝑔(𝑧) ∼ ϒ. The task of identifying 𝑔 must be undertaken empirically, since only ϒ 𝑁 is available to us, not ϒ. A common setting is to assume that 𝜁 is Gaussian. Then the aim is to find map 𝑔 so that samples from Gaussian 𝜁, when pushed forward under 𝑔, will look like samples from ϒ. We will also study relaxations of this problem in which, rather than pushforward the Gaussian 𝜁 under 𝑔, instead 𝜁 is convolved with a Gaussian whose mean is function 𝑔. ♢</p><p>In Section 13.1 we describe the subject of density estimation, introduced in Example 13.2, and taking a particular perspective on it which links to several themes arising in other places in the notes. In the remainder of the chapter we study variants on the idea of measure transport illustrated in Example 13.3. All the methods connect the target measure ϒ, which we wish to sample, and defined on R 𝑑 , to a measure on a latent space R 𝑑𝑧 . In Section 13.2 we study a general approach to measure transport akin to the density estimation approach studied in Section 13.1; typically these methods employ 𝑑 𝑧 = 𝑑. Normalizing flows are studied in 13.3; whilst 𝑑 𝑧 ̸ = 𝑑 is possible here too, in the continuum limit, using neural ODEs, this methodology has at its core an invertible mapping with 𝑑 𝑧 = 𝑑. In Section 13.4 we study score-based approaches that build on Langevin sampling. Sections 13.5 and 13.6 introduce autoencoders and variational autoencoders respectively, where an approximate inverse for 𝑔 is sought, although typically 𝑑 𝑧 &lt; 𝑑 so caution is required to define this carefully. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are introduced in Section 13.7, applicable with 𝑑 𝑧 ̸ = 𝑑.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="13.1">Density Estimation</head><p>Consider the problem of estimating the probability density function underlying data 𝑈 := {𝑢 (𝑛) } 𝑁 𝑛=1 ; we assume the data points 𝑢 (𝑛) ∈ R 𝑑 are drawn i.i.d. from the same distribution. Let 𝒫(R 𝑑 ) denote the set of all probability density functions on R 𝑑 . We seek to solve the problem by finding a probability density function from a tractable class of probability density functions 𝒬 ⊂ 𝒫(R 𝑑 ), for the purpose of computations and for the purpose of revealing an explicit, interpretable form.

The KL divergence defining the objective F, has the form over 𝜃. Of course we cannot evaluate expectation under ϒ exactly and we must work under Data Assumption 13.1. The desired minimization can be achieved, approximately, given only samples from ϒ : replacing expectation with respect to ϒ with expectation with respect to the empirical density ϒ 𝑁 defined in (13.2), we obtain</p><formula xml:id="formula_701">D KL (︀ ϒ‖𝑞(•; 𝜃) )︀ = E 𝑢∼ϒ</formula><formula xml:id="formula_702">-E 𝑢∼ϒ 𝑁 [︁ log 𝑞(𝑢; 𝜃) ]︁ = - 1 𝑁 𝑁 ∑︁ 𝑛=1 log 𝑞(𝑢 (𝑛) ; 𝜃) = 1 𝑁 J 𝑁 MLE (𝜃).</formula><p>Remark 13.4.

This issue arises elsewhere in these notes, and in particular in the next subsection. We emphasize the issue here, in the context of density estimation, since it constitutes the canonical setting in which it arises. ♢</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="13.2">Transport Methods</head><p>Recall Definition 11.7 of a transport map. We continue with the task of characterizing ϒ ∈ 𝒫(R 𝑑 ), from samples. The approach undertaken in this subsection is to find, approximately, an invertible transport map 𝑔 : R 𝑑 → R 𝑑 and probability measure 𝜁 ∈ 𝒫(R 𝑑 ) with the property that ϒ = 𝑔 ♯ 𝜁; equivalently, since 𝑔 is invertible, 𝜁 = (𝑔 -1 ) ♯ ϒ.</p><p>The desiderata are that 𝜁 be easy to sample, so that (approximate) samples from ϒ may be generated by applying (an approximation of) 𝑔 to samples from 𝜁; and that an approximation of 𝑔 may be determined given only ϒ 𝑁 as defined in <ref type="bibr">(13.2)</ref>.</p><p>Imagine that a suitable choice for 𝜁 has been made; a Gaussian is a common choice. Let Θ ⊆ R 𝑝 . We introduce a parametric family of functions 𝑔(•; •) : R 𝑑 × Θ → R 𝑑 . We then seek parameter 𝜃 ∈ Θ ⊆ R 𝑝 such that 𝑔(•; 𝜃) : R 𝑑 → R 𝑑 realizes the desired approximation. To achive this goal, we consider the optimization problem</p><formula xml:id="formula_703">𝜃 ⋆ ∈ arg min 𝜃∈Θ F(𝜃),<label>(13.4a</label></formula><p>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_704">F(𝜃) = D KL (︀ ϒ‖𝑔(•; 𝜃) ♯ 𝜁 )︀ .

Notice that this approach is a special case of the density estimation approach in the preceding Section 13.1: we parameterize the approximating densities 𝑞(•; 𝜃) = 𝑔(•; 𝜃) ♯ 𝜁 as pushforward of a fixed reference density 𝜁 by a parameterized transport map 𝑔(•; 𝜃).</p><p>Remark 13.5. Note that there exist perfect transport maps 𝑔 perfect , for example an optimal transport, for which D KL (ϒ‖(𝑔 perfect ) ♯ 𝜁) = 0. We aim to get as close as possible to a perfect transport solution, within our parametric class, by minimizing F over 𝜃. In practice, since ϒ is typically unknown, this task needs to be undertaken based on the data summarized in the empirical measure ϒ 𝑁 given in (13.2). Whilst optimal transportstudied in Section 11.1.3 in the context of transport distances between probability measures-provides a deep mathematical structure within which to consider the measure transport problem, there are numerous applications where the optimality constraint on the transport confers few advantages over other transports; indeed application of such optimality criteria may unnecessarily complicate the computational task of finding a transport with the desired properties. For these reasons, in this chapter we focus on other approaches to transport that relax the optimality constraint, but preserve the core idea of sampling probability measures by constructing transports from a known distribution 𝜁, that we know how to sample, to the target ϒ. The resulting methodologies resonate with the Monge formulation of optimal transport, but we do not invoke the same optimality criterion. ♢</p><p>As in Section 13.1, to optimize F(•) we will identify J(•), a function which differs from the KL divergence only by a constant independent of 𝜃, and optimize J 𝑁 (•), an empirical approximation of J(•) found by replacing ϒ with ϒ 𝑁 . Lemma 11.40 is useful in determining an explicit form of J. We now deploy this lemma to find a pair of useful expressions for J(•). Using the expression for the KL divergence we find that</p><formula xml:id="formula_705">F(𝜃) = D KL (︀ ϒ‖𝑔(•; 𝜃) ♯ 𝜁 )︀ = E 𝑢∼ϒ [︁ log ϒ(𝑢) -log 𝑔 ♯ 𝜁(𝑢) ]︁ .</formula><p>Thus, noting that the desired minimization is independent of 𝜃-independent constants, and using (11.20b) we define</p><formula xml:id="formula_706">J(𝜃) = -E 𝑢∼ϒ [︁ log 𝜁 ∘ 𝑔 -1 (𝑢; 𝜃) + log det𝐷 𝑢 (𝑔 -1 )(𝑢; 𝜃) ]︁ .

(13.6)</formula><p>In practice, ϒ is only available empirically and hence we work under Data Assumption 13.1.

By minimizing (13.7) we thus find an approximate expression for ϒ as the pushforward under 𝑔 ⋆ (•) = 𝑔(•, 𝜃 * ) of 𝜁 using <ref type="bibr">(11.20)</ref>. That is, ϒ(𝑢) ≈ 𝑔 ⋆ ♯ 𝜁(𝑢) = 𝜋 ∘ 𝑔 -1 (𝑢; 𝜃 * )det𝐷 𝑢 𝑔 -1 (𝑢, 𝜃 * ). (13.8)</p><p>Once we have the map 𝑔 ⋆ , we can generate new (approximate) samples from ϒ by sampling 𝜁 and applying 𝑔 ⋆ . An important point to note here is that, to determine 𝑔 ⋆ , minimization of either form of the loss function J 𝑁 in (13.7) requires evaluation of 𝑔 -1 . Thus 𝑔 must be readily invertible. Section 13.3 addresses this issue in the context of normalizing flows. ♢</p><p>Remark 13.7. The ideas in this section are also useful in the context where ϒ is a known simple measure, from which samples are easily drawn, and 𝜁 is a more complicated measure which we wish to characterize and sample from; in such a setting, which we consider in Section 4.1, the objective is to determine 𝑇 = 𝑔 -1 so that 𝜁 = (𝑔 -1 ) ♯ ϒ. Since (13.5) is expressed entirely in terms of 𝑇 = 𝑔 -1 , and not 𝑔 itself, it is possible to approach this problem by directly parameterizing 𝑇 = 𝑔 -1 rather than 𝑔. ♢</p></div>

Such a method may be viewed as a stochastic transport, over an infinite time horizon, of 𝜁 into ϒ; stochastic because it depends on Brownian motion 𝑊 (•) and infinite time horizon because 𝑢(0) ∼ 𝜁 whilst 𝑢(𝑇 ) ∼ ϒ as 𝑇 → ∞. This discussion of ergodicity suggests sampling via use of the gradient of the log-density of the measure ϒ: 𝐷 log ϒ. This vector field on R 𝑑 is known as the score function. Discretization of the Langevin equation in time, for example by the Euler-Maruyama method, provides a useful proposal distribution for the Metropolis-Hastings MCMC methods introduced in Section 15.5. However, in this section we do not assume that we are given ϒ, only samples from it. In this setting, learning the score function and then solving the Langevin equation over an infinite time horizon, approximately, provides a method for generating new samples from ϒ, based on learning the score. However, other variants on this idea are available and we now present some of them.</p><p>The starting point is to identify a function 𝑠 𝜃 : R 𝑑 → R 𝑑 so that 𝑠 𝜃 ≈ 𝐷 log ϒ.

A natural objective results in the following regression problem:</p><formula xml:id="formula_722">J(𝜃; ϒ) = ∫︁ |𝑠 𝜃 (𝑢) -𝐷 log ϒ(𝑢)| 2 ϒ(𝑢) 𝑑𝑢, (13.20a) 𝜃 ⋆ ∈ arg min 𝜃∈Θ J(𝜃).<label>(13.20b)</label></formula><p>Then 𝑠 ⋆ = 𝑠 𝜃 ⋆ is the approximate score at the optimal 𝜃.</p><p>Remark 13.12.

The root cause is the presence of the true score 𝐷 log ϒ(𝑢) in the objective. The reader will note that log ϒ(𝑢) also entered the objective J for density estimation, as described in Section 13.1. However in that context the terms involving log ϒ(𝑢) decouple from those involving the unknown parameter 𝜃. That does not happen in <ref type="bibr">(13.20)</ref> in an obvious way. However, the following two propositions show that J can be minimized using integration by parts, resulting in redefined objectives that only depend on ϒ in an outer expectation. The first such redefined objective is given in the following proposition.

This gradient is a Hessian matrix of size 𝑑×𝑑 and can be challenging to compute and store in high-dimensions. However, one may leverage techniques from randomized linear algebra to estimate the trace of this matrix. The need to evaluate the Hessian can also be avoided by learning the score not of ϒ but of its convolution with a Gaussian. ♢</p><p>To avoid the need to evaluate the Hessian we introduce the idea of denoising scorematching. This approach estimates the score function for an approximate distribution defined by the convolution of ϒ with a kernel 𝑝 𝜎 : R 𝑑 × R 𝑑 → R + with bandwidth 𝜎 &gt; 0.

(<label>13</label></formula><p>.24) This choice is motivated by the facts that: (i) for bandwidth 𝜎 → 0 we obtain that 𝑝 𝜎 (•; 𝑤) converges to the Dirac measure 𝛿 𝑤 , if appropriately normalized, and so ϒ 𝜎 (𝑢) converges to ϒ(𝑢), the original distribution; (ii) on the other hand, larger bandwidths smooth larger-scale features of ϒ. The following proposition shows that score-matching for ϒ 𝜎 can be performed without knowing the score of ϒ directly. Proposition 13.15. Assume that ∫︁ |𝐷 log ϒ 𝜎 (𝑢)| 2 ϒ 𝜎 (𝑢) 𝑑𝑢 + ∫︁ ∫︁ |𝐷 𝑢 log 𝑝 𝜎 (𝑢, 𝑤)| 2 𝑝 𝜎 (𝑢, 𝑤)ϒ(𝑢) 𝑑𝑤𝑑𝑢 &lt; ∞. Then, the optimal score that minimizes the loss function J(𝜃; ϒ 𝜎 ), found from (13.20) by replacing ϒ with ϒ 𝜎 , is given by 𝑠 ⋆ = 𝑠 𝜃 ⋆ where 𝜃 ⋆ ∈ arg min 𝜃∈Θ ∫︁ ∫︁ |𝑠 𝜃 (𝑢) -𝐷 𝑢 log 𝑝 𝜎 (𝑢, 𝑤)| 2 𝑝 𝜎 (𝑢, 𝑤)ϒ(𝑤) 𝑑𝑢𝑑𝑤.

(13.26) Thus, the inner product of 𝑠 𝜃 and the score of the smoothed distribution is given by ∫︁ ⟨︀ 𝑠 𝜃 (𝑢), 𝐷 log ϒ 𝜎 (𝑢) ⟩︀ ϒ 𝜎 (𝑢) 𝑑𝑢 = ∫︁ ∫︁ ⟨︀ 𝑠 𝜃 (𝑢), 𝐷 𝑢 log 𝑝 𝜎 (𝑢, 𝑤) ⟩︀ 𝑝 𝜎 (𝑢, 𝑤)ϒ(𝑤) 𝑑𝑤𝑑𝑢.

This leaves an optimization problem in which the objective is defined via expectation over 𝜉. Stochastic gradient descent from Chapter 15 may be used to tackle this problem. After training, approximate samples from ϒ may be obtained by sampling 𝑧 ∼ 𝜁 and then sampling 𝑢|𝑧 ∼ 𝒩 (︀ 𝑔(𝑧; 𝜃 𝑔 ), 𝜎 2 𝑔 )︀ . ♢ 13.7 Generative Adversarial Networks The variational autoencoder trains a probabilistic model for 𝑢 ∈ R 𝑑 by learning P(𝑢|𝑧) and specifying P(𝑧). The generative adversarial network is another method for training such a probabilistic model, which also allows for low dimensional latent space. To be concrete we assume that it has the same structural form, namely 𝑢|𝑧 ∼ 𝒩 (︀ 𝑔(𝑧; 𝜃 𝑔 ), 𝜎 2 𝑔 𝐼 )︀ , (13.29a) 𝑧 ∼ 𝒩 (︀ 0, 𝐼 )︀ . (13.29b) Once again the domain and range of 𝑔 is as specified in Section 13.5. With the probabilistic construction (13.29), samples from 𝑢 are created from samples from 𝑧. We write the resulting density for 𝑢, under this generative model, as ϒ 𝑔 ; here 𝑔 connotes the fact that the model is generative. It is desired that samples from ϒ 𝑔 are similar to those specified by the data, which is drawn from density ϒ. The generative adversarial network starts by defining a discriminator d : R 𝑑 × Θ d → [0, 1], to be thought of as taking values which are probabilities. Here Θ d ⊂ R 𝑝 d . It is instructive to think of d(𝑢; 𝜃 d ) as being the probability that 𝑢 is drawn from the density ϒ, and 1 -d(𝑢; 𝜃 d ) as the probability of 𝑢 being drawn from the generative model ϒ 𝑔 . We then define 𝑣</p><formula xml:id="formula_742">: Θ 𝑔 × Θ d → R by 𝑣(𝜃 𝑔 , 𝜃 d ) = E 𝑢∼ϒ [︁ log d(𝑢; 𝜃 d ) ]︁ + E 𝑢∼ϒ𝑔 [︁ log (︀ 1 -d(𝑢; 𝜃 d ) )︀ ]︁ .</formula><p>The optimal parameter values are defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_743">︀ 𝜃 d (𝜃 𝑔 ) ∈ arg max 𝜃 d 𝑣(𝜃 𝑔 , 𝜃 d ), 𝜃 ⋆ 𝑔 ∈ arg min 𝜃𝑔 𝑣 (︀ 𝜃 𝑔 , ̃︀ 𝜃 d (𝜃 𝑔 ) )︀ , 𝜃 ⋆ d = ̃︀ 𝜃 d (𝜃 ⋆ 𝑔 ).</formula><p>In the maximization step, the parameters of the discriminator are chosen to maximize 𝑣 -the discriminator acts adversarially to try and find data under ϒ 𝑔 which does not look like data under ϒ. In the minimization step the generator acts to reduce 𝑣 to try and make the two data sources look similar. Ideally, through an iterative process, a solution is found in which d(•; 𝜃 ⋆ d ) ≡ 1 2 , so that the data and generated data are indistinguishable. The value of 𝜃 ⋆ 𝑔 defines the generative model once this indistinguishable state has been reached.</p></div>

Analog forecasting works as follows. Let 1</p><formula xml:id="formula_744">𝑛 ⋆ ∈ arg min 𝑛∈N d(𝑣 0 , 𝑣 † 𝑛 ).

The intuition behind the forecast is simple to articulate: find the closest point in the data set to 𝑣 0 and ask what happened 𝑞 time units later in the data set; this is used as the prediction. However, the predictions produced by analog forecasting are discontinuous with respect to changes in 𝑣 0 , since the closest point to 𝑣 0 can change discontinuously as 𝑣 0 is varied continuously. In the next subsection we describe a generalization which resolves this undesirable discontinuous behaviour. But before addressing this issue we describe a different limitation of analog forecasting.</p><p>Suppose that {𝑣 † 𝑛 } is generated by the deterministic dynamical system 𝜓, so that</p><formula xml:id="formula_746">𝑣 † 𝑛+1 = 𝜓(𝑣 † 𝑛 ).<label>(14.2a)</label></formula><p>Suppose further that 𝜓 has a global attractor, supporting an invariant measure 𝜇. We employ the following informal definition of an ergodic dynamical system. The process {𝑣 † 𝑛 }, in R 𝑑 , is ergodic if, for a sufficiently wide class 2 of test functions 𝜙,</p><formula xml:id="formula_747">lim 𝑀 →∞ 1 𝑀 𝑀 -1 ∑︁ 𝑚=0 𝜙(𝑣 † 𝑚 ) = ∫︁ R 𝑑 𝜙(𝑣) 𝜇(𝑑𝑣), (<label>14.3)</label></formula><p>with the convergence being almost sure with respect to 𝑣 † 0 drawn from 𝜇. Since the process is deterministic, it is possible that measure 𝜇 will not have density with respect to Lebesgue measure which is why, in contrast to much of the remainder of the notes, we have not used a probability density function in this definition.</p><p>Remark 14.2. The success of analog forecasting depends on the Lyapunov exponents of the system that generated {𝑣 † 𝑛 }. Under conditions described by Oseledet's Theorem (see Bibliography Section 14.5), closely related to the preceding informal definition of ergodicity, we can define the maximal Lyapunov exponent of 𝜓 as</p><formula xml:id="formula_748">𝜆 max = lim 𝑛→∞ lim 𝜖→0 + 1 𝑛 log |𝜓 (𝑛) (𝑣 † + 𝜖𝑒) -𝜓 (𝑛) (𝑣 † )| 𝜖 , (<label>14.4)</label></formula><p>1 The following does not uniquely define the forecast since the argmin may deliver more than one index. We do not dwell on this issue here as the smoothed forecasting methodology from subsection 14.1.2 addresses it in a systematic fashion.</p><p>2 Our definition is informal precisely because we are not specifying the precise class of test functions.</p><p>for 𝜇-almost every 𝑣 † and almost every vector 𝑒 picked uniformly at random from the unit sphere. For chaotic systems the maximal exponent will be larger than zero.</p><p>For simplicity consider the case 𝜓(𝑣) = 𝐴𝑣 where 𝐴 is positive and symmetric (and hence diagonalizable) and the spectral radius of 𝐴, 𝜆, is attained at unique eigenvector 𝜙. This does not satisfy the standard assumptions of the theory, but is simple enough to provide intuition. Provided that the projection of 𝑒 onto 𝜙 is non-zero (which will happen almost surely) it is clear that 𝜆 max = log(𝜆). Thus the maximal Lyapunov exponent delivers, through exponentiation, the typical growth rate of perturbations to the system.</p><p>We now discuss how Lyapunov exponents manifest in analog forecasting. Recall that the analog forecast from 𝑣 0 is found by identifying 𝑛 such that 𝑣 † 𝑛 is the closest point in the data set to 𝑣 0 and setting 𝑣 𝑞 = 𝑣 † 𝑛+𝑞 = 𝜓 (𝑞) (𝑣 † 𝑛 ). Thus, approximately for |𝑣 † 𝑛 -𝑣 0 | small, we have that on average</p><formula xml:id="formula_749">|𝑣 𝑞 -𝜓 (𝑞) (𝑣 0 )| = |𝜓 (𝑞) (𝑣 † 𝑛 ) -𝜓 (𝑞) (𝑣 0 )| ≈ |𝑣 † 𝑛 -𝑣 0 |𝑒 𝜆max𝑞 .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="14.1.2">Kernel Analog Forecasting</head><p>The idea we deploy here to overcome the discontinuous behavior of the simple analog forecasting method in the previous section is an intuitive one: rather than predict using a single closest point in the data set, we predict using multiple points in the data set, but weight them smoothly according to their relevance to the initial point 𝑣 0 from which we wish to make a forecast. To effect this smooth weighting we use kernels as introduced in Definition 11.17.</p><p>Let 𝑝 : R 𝑑 × R 𝑑 → R + be a positive-definite kernel -see Definition 11.17. Then make prediction</p><formula xml:id="formula_750">𝑣 𝑞 = 1 (𝑁 + 1 -𝑞) 𝑁 -𝑞 ∑︁ 𝑛=0 𝑝(𝑣 0 , 𝑣 † 𝑛 )𝑣 † 𝑛+𝑞 . (<label>14.6)</label></formula><p>This method, too, has a simple intuitive explanation, generalizing analog forecasting. Rather than forecasting using 𝑞 steps ahead from a single closest point in the data set to the initial condition, 𝑞-step forecasts are made from the first (𝑁 + 1 -𝑞) points in the data set. These are then weighted according to how close the starting point in the data set is to 𝑣 0 ; the kernel performs this weighting. A typical choice of kernel is the radial basis function kernel 𝑝(𝑣, 𝑤) = exp(-|𝑣 -𝑤| 2 /𝜆). The choice of 𝜆 is crucial to the success of the methodology and should be viewed as a hyperparameter, tuned to the specific data set to hand. Remark 14.3. Assuming that the kernel is continuous in its arguments it follows that this forecast will be continuous with respect to 𝑣 0 . Note that we have only used points in the data set from which it is possible to forecast forward 𝑞 steps. In fact we can only do this for a subset of points in the data given by Data Assumption 14.1. Thus the effective size of the data set is 𝑁 + 1 -𝑞 in <ref type="bibr">(14.6)</ref>. ♢</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="14.2">Recurrent Structure</head><p>As in the previous section we seek to forecast in a purely data-driven way, using Data Assumption 14.1. Here we attempt to forecast by learning a map consistent with the data given in Data Assumption 14.1, and then use that map to forecast. In its simplest form the map is from R 𝑑 into itself, and this map can be composed with itself 𝑞 times, and applied to any initial point 𝑣 0 , to provide a forecast 𝑣 𝑞 . This idea is explained in Subsection 14.2.1. The underlying assumption in trying to predict using a map from R 𝑑 into itself is that the data is generated by a Markovian model on R 𝑑 . If the data is not compatible with this Markovian assumption then memory needs to be accounted for in predicting. In Subsection 14.2.2 we explain how this memory may be accounted for by learning a Markovian model on R 𝑑+𝑟 , where 𝑟 itself is a hyper-parameter to be learned. Subsection 14.2.3 makes a link between the the methods introduced in Subsection 14.2.2 and the idea of random features introduced in Subsection 12.3.</p></div>

We can view this as a generalization of the supervised learning problem, defined by Data Assumption 12.1, where the inputs are no longer i.i.d. . With this connection in mind, we propose to learn 𝜃 as follows</p><formula xml:id="formula_752">J 𝑁 (𝜃) = 1 𝑁 𝑁 -1 ∑︁ 𝑛=0 ⃒ ⃒ 𝑣 † 𝑛+1 -𝜓(𝑣 † 𝑛 ; 𝜃) ⃒ ⃒ 2 , (14.8a) 𝜃 ⋆ ∈ arg min 𝜃∈Θ J 𝑁 (𝜃).

Using this idea with 𝑚 = 2 suggests, for example, consideration of the loss function, for some 𝜆 &gt; 0,</p><formula xml:id="formula_753">J 𝑁 (𝜃) = 1 𝑁 𝑁 -1 ∑︁ 𝑛=0 ⃒ ⃒ 𝑣 † 𝑛+1 -𝜓(𝑣 † 𝑛 ; 𝜃) ⃒ ⃒ 2 + 𝜆 1 (𝑁 -1) 𝑁 -2 ∑︁ 𝑛=0 ⃒ ⃒ 𝑣 † 𝑛+2 -𝜓 (2) (𝑣 † 𝑛 ; 𝜃) ⃒ ⃒ 2 , (<label>14</label></formula><p>.9a) 𝜃 ⋆ ∈ arg min 𝜃∈Θ J 𝑁 (𝜃). (14.9b) Remark 14.4.</p><p>There are many variants on the idea expressed in the optimization problem (14.9), often referred to as roll-out. For example here we have rolled-out over 𝑚 = 2 steps, but other choices of roll-out duration 𝑚 may be employed. Furthermore the roll-out can be employed in a two-step optimization process, first solving (14.8) and only then solving (14.9), initialized at the outcome of the first optimization problem; this is sometimes referred to as fine-tuning. Since neither optimization will be exact in general, this will deliver a different parameter choice than that arising from directly attempting to solve (14.9). Lyapunov exponents (recall (14.4)) play a role in interpreting the incorporation of roll-out. In general, the larger 𝑚, the harder it is to fit the data to 𝑚-fold compositions of 𝜓(•; 𝜃). In particular, for chaotic systems, the maximal Lyapunov exponent will be larger than zero, leading to sensitivity in maps defined by 𝑚-fold composition for larger 𝑚. The two-stage process, where a parameter ball-park is identified, without roll-out, and then it is adjusted to reflect a roll-out, over 𝑚 = 2 or more compositions, can help in training on chaotic systems. ♢</p><p>The following two definitions will be useful to us: Definition 14.5. A discrete-time dynamical system giving rise to data {𝑣 𝑛 } 𝑛∈Z + is said to be strictly stationary if, for all 𝑝 ∈ Z + , the joint distribution of (𝑣 𝑛 , . . . , 𝑣 𝑛+𝑝 ) is the same for all 𝑛 ∈ Z + . It is said to be wide-sense stationary if, for all 𝑝 ∈ Z + , the first and second moments of (𝑣 𝑛 , . . . , 𝑣 𝑛+𝑝 ) are the same for all 𝑛 ∈ Z + . ♢</p><p>The definition applies to both deterministic and random dynamical systems. In the deterministic setting of (14.2) randomness can only enter through the initial condition. It is then natural that this randomness is given by invariant measure 𝜇. Given a stationary process, and assuming ergodicity, it is also natural to make the following definition.</p><p>Definition 14.6. Consider a stationary and ergodic process and assume that pair (𝑣 𝑛 , 𝑣 𝑛+𝑚 ) is distributed according to correlation density 𝜋 𝑚 (𝑣 0 , 𝑣 𝑚 ) in 𝒫(R 𝑑 × R 𝑑 ). The twopoint correlation function of a stationary process is function 𝑐 : Z + → R given by 𝑐(𝑚) := E (𝑣,𝑤)∼𝜋𝑚(•,•) [𝑣𝑤 ⊤ ]. ♢</p><p>In the deterministic setting (14.2) the correlation density</p><formula xml:id="formula_754">𝜓 𝑚 (•, •) is simply the pushforward of 𝜇 under the map 𝑢 ∈ R 𝑑 ↦ → (︀ 𝑢, 𝜓 (𝑚) (𝑢) )︀ ∈ R 𝑑 × R 𝑑 .</formula><p>The population-level optimization problem that the optimization problem (14.8) approximates may be defined as follows.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="14.2.2">Memory And Prediction</head><p>The premise of the preceding subsection is that data in Data Assumption 14.1 derives from a Markov model for 𝑣 𝑛 , such as (14.2), and there often arise settings where this is not the case, even approximately.

The need for memory in time-series prediction can be motivated not only for non-Markovian systems, but also for Markovian but partially observed systems. One way to see this is using Takens' Theorem, which says (roughly) that under quite general conditions, given partial observations of a Markovian system but enough memory, one can reconstruct the original dynamics. We state Takens' Theorem informally; see the bibliography for references. Suppose that 𝜓 : R 𝑑 → R 𝑑 defines a deterministic dynamical system, 𝑣 † 𝑗+1 = 𝜓(𝑣 † 𝑗 ).

Thus, once 𝜃 𝑟 is chosen at random, 𝑟 𝑛 is a random function of the history of the observed data up to time 𝑛 -1. ♢</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="14.3">Linear Autoregressive Models</head><p>The models we have fit to data so far are all deterministic. Here we take the first step towards learning stochastic models of the data. We again work under Data Assumption 14.1. We start by defining the vector autoregressive (VAR) process that will be our object of study in this section.</p><p>Definition 14.10. Let {𝑣 𝑛 } 𝑛∈Z + be an R 𝑑 -valued sequence. The 𝑝th-order VAR model, written VAR(𝑝), is 𝑣 𝑛+1 = 𝑐 + 𝑝-1 ∑︁ ℓ=0 𝐴 ℓ 𝑣 𝑛-ℓ + 𝜀 𝑛 , (14.16) where the 𝐴 ℓ ∈ R 𝑑×𝑑 are fixed matrices, 𝑐 ∈ R 𝑑 is a fixed vector, and 𝜀 𝑛 ∼ 𝒩 (0, 𝐶) is an i.i.d. mean-zero Gaussian sequence in R 𝑑 with fixed covariance 𝐶 ∈ R 𝑑×𝑑 . ♢ Remark 14.11. When 𝑣 𝑛 is a scalar, the process is known simply as an autoregressive (AR) model. Note that it is sometimes useful to consider 𝜀 𝑛 to be a non-Gaussian strictly stationary and ergodic process, but we restrict to the i.i.d Gaussian model here for simplicity. As well as generalizing the foregoing sections by allowing for stochasticity in the dynamics, this model also generalizes what we have seen in previous sections in its treatment of memory. In Subsection 14.2.1 we employed a deterministic Markovian model in R 𝑑 with no memory. And in Subsection 14.2.2 we employed a model which, when viewed as a dynamics model in R 𝑑 , had memory that, for each 𝑛, reaches all the way back to time 0 -this is demonstrated in <ref type="bibr">(14.14)</ref>. The VAR process has memory, if 𝑝 &gt; 1, but the memory is over a fixed finite window, the same for every 𝑛 and determined by 𝑝 -the memory does not stretch back all the way to time 0. ♢</p><p>In the following we take 𝑐 = 0 for simplicity. But the methodological development, and theorem at the end of the section, are readily modified to accommodate the setting 𝑐 ̸ = 0. We also assume that 𝐶 is known and positive definite, so that the unknown parameters of the model are 𝜃 := (𝐴 0 , . . . , 𝐴 𝑝-1 ). (Learning 𝐶 as well is possible, but more complicated to state.) We write the optimization problem</p><formula xml:id="formula_766">J 𝑁 (𝜃) = 1 (𝑁 -𝑝 + 1) 𝑁 -1 ∑︁ 𝑛=𝑝-1 ⃒ ⃒ 𝐶 -1 2 (︀ 𝑣 † 𝑛+1 - 𝑝-1 ∑︁ ℓ=0 𝐴 ℓ 𝑣 † 𝑛-ℓ )︀⃒ ⃒ 2 , (14.17a) 𝜃 ⋆ ∈ arg min 𝜃∈Θ J 𝑁 (𝜃).<label>(14.17b)</label></formula><p>If we assume that the data is generated by a strictly stationary process then there is a population-level limit of this minimization problem.

Assume that 𝑣 0 ∼ 𝒩 (𝑚 0 , 𝐶 0 ).

The vector (𝑣 𝑛 , . . . , 𝑣 𝑛+𝑝 ) will then also be jointly Gaussian with mean zero. To establish strong stationarity it suffices to show that the covariance of (𝑣 𝑛 , . . . , 𝑣 𝑛+𝑝 ) is independent of 𝑛, for any 𝑝 ∈ Z + . To do this it is sufficient to show that the covariance of 𝑣 𝑛 with 𝑣 𝑛+𝑚 is 𝑛-independent, for any 𝑚 ∈ Z + . We note that</p><formula xml:id="formula_771">𝑣 𝑛+𝑚 = 𝐴 𝑚 𝑣 𝑛 + 𝑚 ∑︁ 𝑗=1 𝐴 𝑚-𝑗 𝜀 𝑛+𝑗 .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="14.4">Transport-Based Auto-Regressive Models</head><p>In this section we extend the linear autoregressive models with additive Gaussian noise, from Section 14.3, to a more general nonlinear and non-Gaussian probabilistic form. We do this by modelling non-Gaussian distributions as the pushforward of a Gaussian variable. This is an idea we introduced through transport, in Section 13.2, in the context of generative modelling. We again employ Data Assumption 14.1.</p><p>To motivate the approach we adopt, we first note that the VAR process (14.16) from Section 14.3 may be formulated through use of a conditional probability kernel 𝜋 in the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_772">𝑣 𝑛+1 ∼ 𝜋(•|𝑣 𝑛 , . . . , 𝑣 𝑛-𝑝+1 ; 𝜃) = 𝒩 (︁ 𝑐 + 𝑝-1 ∑︁ ℓ=0 𝐴 ℓ 𝑣 𝑛-ℓ , 𝐶 )︁ (14.19)</formula><p>where, if (𝑐, 𝐶) are assumed known, 𝜃 = (𝐴 0 , . . . , 𝐴 𝑝-1 ). The noise structure assumed in Section 14.3 also implies that the draws 𝑣 𝑛+1 are conditionally independent for each 𝑛. The transition kernel in the VAR model is defined by a standard Gaussian on R 𝑑 ; we generalize this structure in what follows, letting 𝜚(𝑣) denote the standard Gaussian density on R 𝑑 . We introduce a transport 𝑇 ∈ R 𝑝𝑑 × R 𝑑 × Θ, depending on parameters 𝜃 ∈ Θ ⊆ R 𝑞 , so that</p><formula xml:id="formula_773">𝑣 𝑛+1 ∼ 𝜋(•|𝑣 𝑛 , . . . , 𝑣 𝑛-𝑝+1 ; 𝜃) = 𝑇 (𝑣 𝑛 , . . . , 𝑣 𝑛-𝑝+1 , • ; 𝜃) ♯ 𝜚. (<label>14</label></formula><p>.20) We again assume conditional independence of the draws 𝑣 𝑛+1 for each 𝑛. We aim to choose parameter 𝜃 so that this model explains the data given in Data Assumption 14.1. If 𝑇 (𝑣 𝑛 , . . . , 𝑣 𝑛-𝑝+1 , • ; 𝜃) is invertible, then we can use the change-of-variables formula from Lemma 11.40 to express the density of the transformed variable as 𝜋(𝑣 𝑛+1 |𝑣 𝑛 , . . . , 𝑣 𝑛-𝑝+1 ; 𝜃) (14.21) = 𝜚 (︀ 𝑇 (𝑣 𝑛 , . . . , 𝑣 𝑛-𝑝+1 , • ; 𝜃 )︀ -1 | 𝑣 𝑛+1 ) det 𝐷 𝑣 𝑛+1 𝑇 (︀ 𝑣 𝑛 , . . . , 𝑣 𝑛-𝑝+1 , •; 𝜃 )︀ -1 | 𝑣 𝑛+1 . This expression is useful for formulating an optimization problem to determine the choice of 𝜃. Example 14.13. The VAR (14.19) falls into the general class (14.20) with 𝑇 given by 𝑇 (𝑣 𝑛 , . . . , 𝑣 𝑛-𝑝+1 , 𝑧; 𝜃) = 𝑐 + 𝑝-1</p><formula xml:id="formula_774">∑︁ ℓ=0 𝐴 ℓ 𝑣 𝑛-ℓ + 𝐶 1/2 𝑧.</formula><p>where, if (𝑐, 𝐶) are assumed known, 𝜃 = (𝐴 0 , . . . , 𝐴 𝑝-1 ). ♢</p><p>To simplify the exposition we continue our discussion of transport-based learning of probabilistic models in the restricted setting where 𝑝 = 1. In this case, our goal is to find invertible transports 𝑇 : R 𝑑 × R 𝑑 × Θ → R 𝑑 so that 𝜋(𝑣 𝑛+1 |𝑣 𝑛 , 𝜃) := 𝑇 (𝑣 𝑛 , 𝜖; 𝜃) ♯ 𝜚(𝑣 𝑛+1 ) models the conditional distribution for the state at the next time. To simplify the notation, we denote the inverse map 𝑇 (𝑣 𝑛 , •) -1 | 𝑣 𝑛+1 by 𝑆(𝑣 𝑛 , 𝑣 𝑛+1 ; 𝜃). The following result, which provides a canonical working example in the 𝑝 = 1 setting, follows directly from (14.21). Proposition 14.14. Consider the probabilistic model <ref type="bibr">(14.20)</ref> in the case where 𝑝 = 1. If 𝑇 (𝑣, 𝜖; 𝜃) = 𝜓(𝑣; 𝜃) + 𝐶 1/2 𝜖, for some map 𝜓 : R 𝑑 × Θ → R 𝑑 and positive definite matrix 𝐶 ∈ R 𝑑×𝑑 , then we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_775">𝑆(𝑣, 𝑤; 𝜃) = 𝐶 -1/2 (︀ 𝑤 -𝜓(𝑣; 𝜃) )︀ , 𝜋(𝑤|𝑣; 𝜃) = 𝜚 (︁ 𝐶 -1/2 (︀ 𝑤 -𝜓(𝑣; 𝜃) )︀ )︁ det 𝐶 -1/2 , = 1 √︁ (2𝜋) 𝑑 |𝐶| exp (︁ -|𝑤 -𝜓(𝑣; 𝜃)| 2 𝐶 )︁</formula><p>.</p><p>That is, the conditional distribution for the next state 𝑣 𝑛+1 , 𝜋(</p><p>•|𝑣 𝑛 ; 𝜃), is a multivariate Gaussian of the form 𝒩 (︀ 𝜓(𝑣 𝑛 ), 𝐶 )︀ . Given a sequence of data, we can learn the transport parameters by maximizing the log-likelihood of consecutive data pairs {(𝑣 † 𝑛 , 𝑣 † 𝑛+1 )} 𝑁 -2 𝑛=0 under the model. From (14.21) we obtain, in case 𝑝 = 1, 𝜋(𝑣 𝑛+1 |𝑣 𝑛 ; 𝜃) = 𝜚 (︀ 𝑆(𝑣 𝑛 , 𝑣 𝑛+1 ; 𝜃 )︀ det 𝐷 𝑣 𝑛+1 𝑆(𝑣 𝑛 , 𝑣 𝑛+1 ; 𝜃). (14.22) Because of the assumed conditional independence structure, 𝜋(𝑣 𝑛+1 |𝑣 𝑛 , 𝜃) defines a Markov chain on R 𝑑 . If we assume that 𝑣 † 0 ∼ 𝑝 0 then the probability of sequence {𝑣 † 𝑛 } 𝑛∈N from Data Assumption 14.1 is, using the Markov structure, given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_776">(︁ Π 𝑁 -1 𝑛=0 𝜋(𝑣 † 𝑛+1 |𝑣 † 𝑛 ; 𝜃) )︁ 𝑝 0 (𝑣 † 0 ).</formula><p>We assume that 𝑝 0 does not depend on 𝜃.

The optimal transport parameters are then given by 𝜃 ⋆ ∈ arg min 𝜃 L(𝜃).</p><p>Remark 14.15. Here we have assumed that 𝑝 0 is 𝜃-independent. Another natural situation is where 𝑝 0 is the invariant measure associated with the process giving rise to data in Data Assumption 14.1. In this case 𝑝 0 depends on 𝜃 and the estimation problem is more complicated. ♢ Example 14.16. A commonly used non-Gaussian model is based on a nonlinear diagonal transformation of the form 𝑆(𝑣 𝑛 , 𝑣 𝑛+1 ; 𝜃) = 𝑠(𝑣 𝑛+1 -𝜓(𝑣 𝑛 ; 𝜃); 𝜃), where 𝑠(•; 𝜃) : R 𝑑 → R 𝑑 is an invertible function, with inverse 𝑠 -1 (•; 𝜃) : R 𝑑 → R 𝑑 , for all 𝜃 ∈ Θ, and 𝜓 ∈ R 𝑑 × Θ → R 𝑑 . This can be re-written in terms of the direct transport as 𝑇 (𝑣 𝑛 , 𝜖; 𝜃) = 𝜓(𝑣 𝑛 ; 𝜃) + 𝑠 -1 (𝜖; 𝜃), 𝜖 ∼ 𝜚. That is, the next state is given by the previous state with additive noise, which is non-Gaussian for nonlinear 𝑠. The joint distribution for the states at all times 𝑛 that follow this process is often referred to as a non-paranormal or Gaussian copula model. ♢ Example 14.17. Assume that 𝑆(𝑣 𝑛 , 𝑣 𝑛+1 ; 𝜃) = 𝑣 𝑛+1 -𝜓(𝑣 𝑛 ; 𝜃), as in Proposition (14.14) with 𝐶 = 𝐼. Then we have 𝐷 𝑣 𝑛+1 𝑆(𝑣 𝑛 , 𝑣 𝑛+1 ) = 𝐼. Thus, the learning problem based on the loss function in (14.23) reduces to</p><formula xml:id="formula_778">𝜃 ⋆ ∈ arg min 𝜃 1 2𝑁 𝑁 -1 ∑︁ 𝑛=0 [︁ |𝑣 † 𝑛+1 -𝜓(𝑣 † 𝑛 ; 𝜃)| 2 ]︁</formula><p>.</p><p>That is, we can identify the model parameters by solving a supervised learning problem for the nonlinear map 𝜓. This is the setting of Subsection 14.2.1. ♢ Remark 14.18. In Chapter 4 we show how to model non-Gaussian distributions, also using transport, in the context of Bayesian inverse problems. ♢</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Optimization and Sampling</head><p>This chapter provides an introduction to various topics in optimization and sampling that are particularly pertinent to machine learning, inverse problems and data assimilation. Section 15.1 is concerned with gradient-based optimization, including deterministic and stochastic gradient descent. In Section 15.2 we discuss Newton and Gauss-Newton optimization methods for nonlinear least squares; these algorithms use full or partial Hessian information to define a preconditioner and thereby accelerate the convergence. Section 15.3 describes derivative-free ensemble Kalman methods for nonlinear least squares; these methods, which are intimately related to ensemble Kalman filters for data assimilation studied in Chapter 6, rely on the first two empirical moments of an ensemble of particles to determine the search direction and to define a preconditioner. Section 15.4 is devoted to expectation maximization, an important optimization algorithm to compute maximum likelihood estimators when the likelihood is intractable but can be expressed as the marginal of a tractable extended likelihood. Section 15.5 describes the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and Gibbs samplers, two Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms to produce approximate samples from a target distribution. Finally, since many optimization and sampling algorithms involve derivatives of the objective and computing these derivatives can be a limiting computational bottleneck, in Section 15.6 we study auto-differentiation. These techniques have greatly contributed to the scalability and efficiency of modern optimization and sampling algorithms in machine learning and related tasks. Other topics in optimization and sampling are referenced in the bibliography Section 15.7</p><p>Before moving into these sections we recall a definitions that will be useful in what follows.

Differentiating the approximation of J(𝑢 𝑗 + 𝑣) given in (15.9) with respect to 𝑣, and then setting this derivative to 0, gives 𝐷J(𝑢 𝑗 ) + 𝐷 2 J(𝑢 𝑗 )𝑣 = 0, and thus 𝑣 = -(︀ 𝐷 2 J(𝑢 𝑗 ) )︀ -1 𝐷J(𝑢 𝑗 ).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="15.3">Ensemble Kalman Inversion</head><p>This section discusses Ensemble Kalman inversion (EKI) as a general-purpose ensemble Kalman method for nonlinear least squares. Compared to the variants on gradient descent and Newton methods studied in the previous two sections, EKI has the advantage of being derivative-free. For this reason, EKI is widely used in inverse problems with complex forward models; indeed, as its name suggests, EKI was first developed as a method for numerical solution of inverse problems, and only more recently formulated as a general-purpose and broadly useful optimization algorithm.</p><p>Consider the cost function</p><formula xml:id="formula_789">J(𝑢) = 1 2 |𝑦 -𝐺(𝑢)| 2 Γ ,</formula><p>for some (possibly) nonlinear function 𝐺 : R 𝑑 → R 𝑘 , point 𝑦 ∈ R 𝑘 and matrix Γ ≻ 0. Notice that this nonlinear least squares objective is of the form in equation (15.10a); this can be seen by setting 𝑚 := 𝑘 and G(𝑢) := 𝑦 -𝐺(𝑢). Notice further that in the language of Chapter 1, the objective function J(𝑢) = -log P(𝑦|𝑢) = -log l(𝑦|𝑢) is the negative log-likelihood function determined by inverse problem (1.1) with Gaussian noise 𝜂 ∼ 𝒩 (0, Γ). Therefore, minimizing J(𝑢) corresponds to maximizing the likelihood, and this interpretation underpins the original derivation of the method.</p><p>EKI involves first drawing an initial set of 𝑁 particles from a pre-specified probability measure; to be concrete we will employ a Gaussian with a given mean 𝑚 0 and covariance 𝐶 0 . Thus 𝑢 (𝑛) 0 ∼ 𝒩 (𝑚 0 , 𝐶 0 ) i.i.d., 𝑛 = 1, . . . , 𝑁.</p><p>EKI then proceeds to evolve these particles for iterations 𝑗 = 1, . . . , 𝐽 using an iteration that allows the individual particles to interact through empirical covariance information. The resulting algorithm takes the form )︀ -1 .</p><p>Remark 15.13. The algorithm produces an ensemble {𝑢 (𝑛) 𝑗 } 𝑁 𝑛=1 that, for each 𝑗, remains in the linear span of the initial ensemble {𝑢 (𝑛) 0 } 𝑁 𝑛=1 . Thus the algorithm may be viewed as seeking to minimize the objective function over a finite-dimensional subspace. In the case of linear 𝐺(•) the methodology is amenable to a complete theoretical analysis, demonstrating sublinear convergence. However variants on it, including Tikhonov regularization, restore linear convergence . Continuous time limits may also be derived, and then analyzed analogously in the linear setting. It is empirically observed that EKI often provides good approximations of the minimizer of the loss function in the nonlinear setting, and does so for relatively small 𝐽 and 𝑁 . See citations in the bibliography Section 15.7. ♢ Remark 15.14. As the name suggests, there is a link between EKI and the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) for data assimilation, defined in Subsection 6.3.5. One way of seeing this connection is via the formulation of certain maximum likelihood optimization problems as filtering problems. Another way of viewing the connection is to note that, at every iteration, EKI approximates the solution to a nonlinear inverse problem using an ensemble approximation to the solution of a linear Gaussian inverse problem (Example 1.12) and formally replacing the linear forward model with the nonlinear one. We also note that in the setting of linear 𝐺 the EKI methodology is connected to a preconditioned gradient descent These connections are detailed in the bibliography Section 15.7. ♢</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="15.4">Expectation Maximization</head><p>The expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is a general-purpose approach to maximum likelihood estimation with latent variables. Let 𝑢 ∈ R 𝑑 be the parameter of interest, 𝑦 ∈ R 𝑘 the data, and 𝑧 ∈ R 𝑑𝑧 a latent variable. We seek to compute the maximum likelihood estimator of parameter 𝑢 given data 𝑦; that is, we seek to maximize objective J : R 𝑑 → R given by J(𝑢) := P(𝑦|𝑢) = ∫︁ P(𝑦, 𝑧|𝑢) 𝑑𝑧.</p><p>(15.12)</p><p>The EM algorithm is useful when we cannot readily evaluate the likelihood J(𝑢) = P(𝑦|𝑢) or compute its gradient, but evaluating the full likelihood P(𝑦, 𝑧|𝑢) is easier. As explained in Chapter 8, this situation arises naturally in data assimilation when estimating parameters in the dynamics model, in which case the hidden state represents the latent variable. The objective function in (15.12) for the EM algorithm resembles that in (15.5) for stochastic gradient descent, where intractable objective J(𝑢) is defined by averaging tractable objective 𝐹 (𝑢, 𝑧) over auxiliary variables 𝑧 ∈ R 𝑑𝑧 . Notice, however, that in this section we depart from the convention in previous sections and formulate the optimization problem in terms of maximizing rather than minimizing objective J.</p><p>A key component in the derivation of the EM algorithm is encapsulated in the following definition: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>♢</head><p>The following result establishes a lower bound on the log-likelihood function log J(𝑢) = log P(𝑦|𝑢) in terms of an ELBO. Note that P(𝑦, • |𝑢) is not normalized when viewed as a probability density for variable 𝑧 alone; however, it is of course normalized with respect to the joint distribution on the pair (𝑦, 𝑧).</p><p>The following theorem quantifies the difference between log J(𝑢) and ℒ(𝑞, 𝑢).

A similar result is also used in the proof of Theorem 7.8 in Chapter 7. + log J(𝑢), as desired.</p><p>Recall our goal of maximizing, with respect to parameter 𝑢, the likelihood function J(𝑢) = P(𝑦|𝑢). Since the logarithm is monotonic increasing on the positive reals, this task is equivalent to maximizing the log-likelihood log J(𝑢) = log P(𝑦|𝑢). Our starting point is to use <ref type="bibr">(15.13)</ref> for this purpose. Note that the identity depends on a free choice of the probability density function 𝑞. The EM algorithm is an iterative method which generates sequence {𝑢 𝑗 , 𝑞 𝑗 } 𝑗∈Z + by alternating the maximization of ℒ(𝑞, 𝑢) with respect to 𝑞 and 𝑢 :</p><p>1.

Hence, the quantity to maximize is the expected value of the joint log-density log P(𝑦, 𝑧|𝑢) with respect to 𝑞 𝑗 (𝑧) = P(𝑧|𝑦, 𝑢 𝑗 ). The E-step corresponds to computing ℒ(𝑞 𝑗 , 𝑢) from (15.16); the M-step corresponds to maximizing the resulting expression over 𝑢 to obtain 𝑢 𝑗+1 . Combining these two steps gives the EM algorithm: The following result shows that the EM framework has the desirable property that the likelihood function increases monotonically along iterates 𝑢 𝑗 . The first inequality follows because 𝑢 𝑗+1 ∈ arg max 𝑢 ℒ(𝑞 𝑗 , 𝑢); the second follows from <ref type="bibr">(15.14)</ref> and the fact that all divergences are non-negative; the final equality follows from <ref type="bibr">(15.14)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">(15.15)</ref>. Remark 15.20. As a consequence of Theorem 15.19 it is possible to deduce-under mild assumptions-that the iterates 𝑢 𝑗 of the EM algorithm converge, as 𝑗 → ∞, to a local maximizer of the likelihood function. It is important to note, however, that the expectation in the E-step and the optimization in the M-step are often intractable. Monte Carlo, filtering, or smoothing algorithms may be employed to approximate the Estep, and optimization algorithms to approximate the M-step. Such approximations can cause loss of monotonicity and can interfere with the convergence guarantees provided by Theorem 15.19. ♢</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="15.5">Markov Chain Monte Carlo</head><p>In this section we turn our attention to the problem of drawing samples from a given target distribution 𝜋. We will focus on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, a wide class of methods that share the idea of generating samples from a Markov chain for which the target is an invariant distribution. To describe MCMC we first recall that a Markov kernel is a function 𝑝 : R 𝑑 × R 𝑑 → R satisfying:</p><p>• 𝑝(𝑢, 𝑣) ≥ 0 for all 𝑢, 𝑣 ∈ R 𝑑 ; and</p><p>• ∫︀ R 𝑑 𝑝(𝑢, 𝑣) 𝑑𝑣 = 1 for all 𝑢 ∈ R 𝑑 . For fixed 𝑢 ∈ R 𝑑 , 𝑝(𝑢, •) defines a probability density function on R 𝑑 ; if the chain is currently at 𝑢 ∈ R 𝑑 then 𝑝(𝑢, •) enables calculation of the probability with which the chain will be in any given Borel subset of R 𝑑 after one time-step. The idea of MCMC is to define a Markov kernel with the property that the target 𝜋 is an invariant distribution for the kernel. This means that if we sample an initial draw 𝑢 (0) ∼ 𝜋 and subsequently draw 𝑢 (𝑛+1) ∼ 𝑝(𝑢 (𝑛) , •), 0 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 𝑁 -1, (15.17) then it holds that 𝑢 (𝑛) ∼ 𝜋 for all 1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 𝑁. Moreover, it is possible to show under mild assumptions that even when the initial draw 𝑢 (0) is sampled from initial distribution 𝜋 0 different from 𝜋, the distribution of the 𝑛-th draw 𝑢 (𝑛) defined by (15.17) converges to 𝜋 in the large 𝑛 asymptotic. In the next two subsections we introduce two classes of MCMC methods that are widely used in inverse problems, data assimilation and other applications: the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and the Gibbs sampler.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="15.5.1">The Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm</head><p>We consider first the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, a versatile MCMC approach to define a Markov kernel 𝑝 MH that can be readily sampled and which satisfies detailed balance with respect to 𝜋; that is, for all 𝑢, 𝑣 ∈ R 𝑑 it holds that 𝜋(𝑢)𝑝 MH (𝑢, 𝑣) = 𝜋(𝑣)𝑝 MH (𝑣, 𝑢). <ref type="bibr">(15.18)</ref> Integrating over 𝑢 delivers which is the desired invariance property. The key idea behind the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is that kernel 𝑝 MH satisfying (15.18) can be defined by sampling from a proposal Markov kernel 𝑞, chosen to be easy to sample from, and an accept/reject step. Given the 𝑛-th sample 𝑢 (𝑛) , we obtain the (𝑛 + 1)-th sample through a two-step process. First, we propose 𝑣 * ∼ 𝑞(𝑢 (𝑛) , •) by sampling from the proposal Markov kernel. Second, we accept this proposal and set 𝑢 (𝑛+1) = 𝑣 * with probability 𝑎(𝑢 (𝑛) , 𝑣 * ); otherwise, we reject it and set 𝑢 (𝑛+1) = 𝑢 (𝑛) . The Metropolis-Hastings acceptance probability is defined by 𝑎(𝑢, 𝑣) := min {︂ 1, 𝜋(𝑣) 𝜋(𝑢) 𝑞(𝑣, 𝑢) 𝑞(𝑢, 𝑣) }︂ , 𝑢, 𝑣 ∈ R 𝑑 . (15.19) This definition ensures that the Markov kernel 𝑝 MH that determines the probabilistic transition from 𝑢 (𝑛) to 𝑢 (𝑛+1) satisfies the detailed balance condition (15.18). Algorithm 15.2 outlines the procedure.

Remark 15.21. Notice that the target distribution only enters the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm in the acceptance probability <ref type="bibr">(15.19)</ref>; since this formula only involves the ratio of the target density at the proposed and current values of the chain, the acceptance probability can be computed even when the target distribution is only known up to normalization constant. ♢</p><p>The choice of proposal Markov kernel has a major impact on the performance of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Table <ref type="table">15</ref>.1 contains three illustrative choices of proposal Markov kernel that lead to important instantiations of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, known as the random walk Metropolis-Hastings (RWMH) algorithm, the Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA) and the preconditioned Crank-Nicolson (pCN) method. These three proposals depend on a user-chosen parameter 𝛽, with 𝛽 &gt; 0 for RWMH and MALA, and 𝛽 ∈ (0, 1) for pCN. Proposal 𝑣 * can be obtained by drawing  15.5.2 The Gibbs Sampler Another important MCMC algorithm is the Gibbs sampler, where each one-dimensional coordinate 𝑢 𝑖 of 𝑢 ∈ R 𝑑 is updated in turn by sampling from the target's full conditional distributions given by 𝜋 𝑖 (𝑢 𝑖 |𝑢 -𝑖 ) := 𝜋(𝑢) 𝜋(𝑢 -𝑖 ) , where 𝜋(𝑢 -𝑖 ) := ∫︁ R 𝜋(𝑢 1 , . . . , 𝑢 𝑖-1 , 𝑣, 𝑢 𝑖+1 , . . . , 𝑢 𝑑 ) 𝑑𝑣.</p><p>Importantly, the full conditionals are probability densities on R and the cost of sampling from these distributions need not, in general, scale with the dimension 𝑑 of the parameter 𝑢 ∈ R 𝑑 .

Remark 15.23. The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and the Gibbs sampler were developed independently and have distinct flavors: in Metropolis-Hastings we propose an update 𝑣 * of all coordinates of 𝑢 at once, and accept or reject this update probabilistically; in contrast, in the Gibbs sampler we update each coordinate in turn by sampling from the target's full conditional, and there is no accept/reject step. Despite these differences, it is possible to view the Gibbs sampler as a Metropolis-Hastings method in which at each iteration a proposal Markov kernel is defined via a full conditional. With such a choice of proposal Markov kernel, the acceptance probability in the accept/reject step of the Metropolis-Hasting algorithm automatically simplifies to be 1, explaining the lack of an accept/reject step in the Gibbs sampler. ♢ Rather than updating a single coordinate at a time, it is often useful to perform Gibbs updates block-wise. To explain this idea, let 𝑢 = (𝑢 𝑎 𝑢 𝑏 ) ∈ R 𝑑 with 𝑢 𝑎 ∈ R 𝑑𝑎 , 𝑢 𝑏 ∈ R 𝑑 𝑏 and 𝑑 𝑎 + 𝑑 𝑏 = 𝑑. We can then update 𝑢 𝑎 and 𝑢 𝑏 in turn by sampling from the target's full conditionals 𝜋 𝑎 (𝑢 𝑎 |𝑢 -𝑎 ) := 𝜋(𝑢) 𝜋(𝑢 -𝑎 ) , 𝜋 𝑏 (𝑢 𝑏 |𝑢 -𝑏 ) := 𝜋(𝑢) 𝜋(𝑢 -𝑏 ) , where 𝜋(𝑢 -𝑎 ) := ∫︁ R 𝑑 𝑏 𝜋(𝑣, 𝑢 𝑏 ) 𝑑𝑣, 𝜋(𝑢 -𝑏 ) := ∫︁ R 𝑑𝑎 𝜋(𝑢 𝑎 , 𝑣) 𝑑𝑣. The procedure is outlined in Algorithm 15.4: Algorithm 15.4 Block-Wise Gibbs Sampler 1: Input: Target distribution 𝜋, initial distribution 𝜋 0 , test function 𝑓, number of samples 𝑁. 2: Initial Draw: Draw initial sample 𝑢 (0) ∼ 𝜋 0 . 3: Subsequent Samples: For 𝑛 = 0, 1, . . . , 𝑁 -1 1.

The Gibbs sampler tends to converge more quickly when highly correlated coordinates are blocked together. On the other hand conditionals can become hard to sample from if many coordinates are blocked together. Optimizing this trade-off is central to the successful implementation of the Gibbs sampler. In determining how to optimize this trade-off it is useful to note that, when sampling from the full conditionals is challenging, a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm can be employed to sample from them. The resulting algorithm, which goes under the name of Metropolis-within-Gibbs, preserves the desired stationary distribution if any number of Metropolis-Hastings steps is used, instead of an exact sample from a conditional. However replacing exact condtional sampling with approximate Metropolis-Hastings steps will typically slow down the rate of convergence of the overall algorithm. ♢</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="15.6">Automatic Differentiation</head><p>Gradients (and higher-order derivatives) are often difficult to obtain in closed form for complex cost functions. Finite difference approximations, on the other hand, are often inaccurate and expensive for high-dimensional problems. Automatic differentiation involves repeated application of chain rule on elementary operations that enables computing derivatives accurately to working precision. That is, suppose an output variable 𝑦 ∈ R 𝑑𝑛 is related to an input variable 𝑥 ∈ R 𝑑 0 by some function 𝑓 , i.e., 𝑦 = 𝑓 (𝑥), and suppose that the Jacobian of 𝑓 is not readily available in closed form. We assume the implementation of 𝑓 in computer code is made up of 𝑛 elementary operations 𝑓 𝑖 : R 𝑑 𝑖-1 → R 𝑑 𝑖 (for instance, addition, multiplication, logarithms, etc.), such that 𝑓 (𝑥) = 𝑓 𝑛 ∘ 𝑓 𝑛-1 ∘ • • • ∘ 𝑓 1 (𝑥). <ref type="bibr">(15.21)</ref> We assume further that the Jacobians for these elementary operations, 𝐷𝑓 𝑖 : R 𝑑 𝑖-1 → R 𝑑 𝑖 ×𝑑 𝑖-1 , are available in closed form. The goal of automatic differentiation is to evaluate 𝐷𝑓 (𝑥) from the Jacobians of the elementary operations. We define the identity function 𝑔 0 = 𝑥 and then recursively define function 𝑔 𝑖 = 𝑓 𝑖 (𝑔 𝑖-1 ); note that then 𝑓 = 𝑔 𝑛 . By representing the output 𝑔 𝑖 of each step in the recursion by a node, we can use a graph to represent the function evaluation where the directed edges encode the input dependencies 𝑔 𝑖-1 (the parents) that are required in the evaluation of 𝑓 𝑖 . This is known as the computational graph. The nodes without parents correspond to the original inputs 𝑥 to the function 𝑓 . After constructing the graph, we can define the forward mode as the process of computing the output 𝑦, and possibly the gradient of 𝑓 , by traversing the graph starting from the inputs 𝑥. The reverse mode starts with the final output node and traverses the graph back to the inputs to compute the gradient of 𝑓 . The following two subsections demonstrate how the full Jacobian of 𝑓 is assembled in forward and reverse mode automatic differentiation.</p><p>Remark 15.25. In realistic implementations, instead of multiplying the full Jacobians of each operation, only the partial derivatives of variables that interact with each other in the computational graph are used. For simplicity of exposition, we present the algorithms with the full Jacobians here. Assuming for simplicity that all the 𝑑 𝑖 except for 𝑑 0 and 𝑑 𝑛 are fixed at 𝑑, we have a cost c 𝑓 given by c 𝑓 = 𝑑 2 (𝑛 -2)𝑑 0 + 𝑑 𝑛 𝑑𝑑 0 . (15.23)</p><p>We now introduce as different way of computing 𝐷𝑓 (•) which reverses the order of arithmetic operations, resulting in a different computational cost c 𝑟 . The difference in computational cost compared to forward mode differentiation stems from the fact that, while matrix multiplication is associative, the complexity is not.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="15.6.2">Reverse Mode</head><p>Reverse mode automatic differentiation also computes the product of Jacobians <ref type="bibr">(15.22)</ref>, but instead of computing the product from right to left, it computes it from left to right.

Again assuming that all the 𝑑 𝑖 are fixed at 𝑑 except for 𝑑 0 and 𝑑 𝑛 , the total cost c 𝑟 is given by c 𝑟 = 𝑑 2 (𝑛 -2)𝑑 𝑛 + 𝑑 𝑛 𝑑𝑑 0 . (15.24)</p><p>We may now compare c 𝑓 and c 𝑟 given by (15.23) and <ref type="bibr">(15.24)</ref>. This comparison shows that forward mode is advantageous when 𝑑 𝑛 is large whereas reverse mode is advantageous when 𝑑 0 is large. As an example, if 𝑑 0 is fixed and 𝑑 𝑛 = 𝑑, then, in the large 𝑑 asymptotic, forward mode has quadratic cost in 𝑑 whereas reverse mode has cubic cost in 𝑑. In contrast, if 𝑑 𝑛 is fixed and 𝑑 0 = 𝑑, then, in the large 𝑑 asymptotic, forward mode has cubic cost in 𝑑 whereas reverse mode has quadratic cost in 𝑑.</p><p>Remark 15.26. In many machine learning tasks inputs are high dimensional but outputs are real-valued; in that setting, reverse mode differentiation is preferred. Backpropagation, a common method for computing the gradient of the objective function with respect to the weights of a neural network, is a special case of reverse mode differentiation. ♢</p></div>

There is another growing class of methodologies, which also solve optimization problems in a derivative-free fashion, based on the idea of interacting particle systems which achieve consensus <ref type="bibr" target="#b362">[342]</ref>. In contrast to ensemblebased methods, these methods do not invoke a Gaussian approximation and hence can achieve provably good approximations of global optima on a wide-range of problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[87]</ref>; however they have yet to be shown to be effective on the large-scale applications where ensemble Kalman methods excel.</p><p>The EM framework for maximum likelihood estimation was introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">[126]</ref>; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b323">[303]</ref> for a review and see <ref type="bibr" target="#b390">[370]</ref> for an insightful connection to Gibbs sampling. The generalization of the EM framework for optimization problems where the objective does not necessarily involve conditional expectations is known as the Minorize-Maximization (MM), or equivalently Majorize-Minimization, algorithm. An overview of MM algorithms and their properties can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b283">[263]</ref>.</p><p>Reinforcement learning, a form of online optimization, is seeing growing use in numerous applications of machine learning. For historical underpinnings of the field see <ref type="bibr" target="#b253">[233,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b427">407]</ref>; for recent developments see <ref type="bibr" target="#b463">[443,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">26]</ref>. Bayesian optimization is another popular online optimization method <ref type="bibr" target="#b173">[153]</ref> based on the idea of building a surrogate model of the objective by evaluating it at carefully chosen query points. Bayesian optimization is a particularly useful global optimization method in applications where the objective function is expensive to evaluate and the dimension is moderate.</p><p>As discussed for instance in <ref type="bibr" target="#b185">[165,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b393">373]</ref>, optimization and sampling are closely related. A workhouse sampling algorithm for Bayesian computation is Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) that builds a sequence of correlated samples from a target distribution; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">[159,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b326">306]</ref> for a general introduction. MCMC methods can also be useful for nonconvex optimization by constructing a target distribution from the objective function. We refer to Section 1.6 for more references and discussion on Monte Carlo methods, including quasi Monte Carlo (QMC) and sequential Monte Carlo (SMC).</p><p>A detailed overview of automatic differentiation is given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b205">[185]</ref>. For a survey of automatic differentiation in machine learning, we refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[44]</ref>. Automatic differentiation is a central tool in machine learning, allowing users to implement highly complex neural network architectures without worrying about the calculation of gradients to optimize the parameters. Automatic differentiation has also contributed to popularize gradientbased sampling algorithms based on Langevin or Hamiltonian dynamics in applications where calculation of derivatives was previously unfeasible. Automatic differentiation is now available in most programming languages as a package or extension.</p></div>

(pCN proposal) In each case, the parameter 𝛽 controls how far proposed sample 𝑣 * ∼ 𝑞(𝑢, •) is, on average, from the current state 𝑢 ∈ R 𝑑 of the chain. Smaller 𝛽 leads to 𝑣 * being closer to 𝑢, and thus to Metropolis-Hastings algorithms with slow exploration but high acceptance rate. Many theoretical and heuristic guidelines are available to choose the step-size 𝛽. This choice can be made offline (i.e. before implementing the algorithm) but also online (i.e. adapting the choice as the chain runs, based on its output). 15.22.RWMH was the first MCMC algorithm to be developed, and it is still widely used due to its simplicity. MALA adds gradient information from the target distribution so that proposed samples tend to move to regions of higher target density; this algorithm is closely related to the score-based approach for generative modeling considered in Section 13.4; indeed the MALA proposal arises from Euler-Maruyama discretization of the Langevin equation. The pCN proposal modifies RWMH to obtain a proposal Markov kernel that satisfies detailed balance with respect to Gaussian density 𝜌 := 𝒩 (0, 𝐼 𝑑 ). In particular if 𝜋(𝑢) ∝ exp This idea can be generalized to settings where 𝜌 is any Guassian measure; it is useful for sampling target distributions arising as posterior distributions arising in Bayesian inverse problems with Gaussian prior 𝜌. ♢</figDesc><table><row><cell cols="4">Remark (︀</cell><cell>-Φ(𝑢) )︀</cell><cell cols="4">𝜌(𝑢) then for the pCN proposal the</cell></row><row><cell cols="4">acceptance probability (15.19) becomes</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>𝑎(𝑢, 𝑣) := min</cell><cell>{︂</cell><cell>1, exp (︀</cell><cell cols="3">Φ(𝑢) -Φ(𝑣) )︀</cell><cell>}︂</cell><cell>,</cell><cell>𝑢, 𝑣 ∈ R 𝑑 .</cell><cell>(15.20)</cell></row></table></figure>

Starting from the variational auto-encoding framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b267">[247]</ref> that operationalized amortization in the machine learning community, neural architectures specifically for nonlinear filtering and smoothing via amortized variational inference were considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b275">[255,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b260">240]</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b208">188]</ref> explored applications of this approach to hierarchical decision-making and model-based reinforcement learning. In addition, the related Neural Process framework in <ref type="bibr" target="#b186">[166,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b187">167]</ref> learns to map sets of time-series observations to variational distributions for probabilistic inference after training on a family of stochastic processes. Among classical data assimilation algorithms, learning 4DVar was considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">[150]</ref>. For work on learning controllers, a subject closely related to learning data assimilation algorithms in the presence of model error, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">[146,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b141">121]</ref>. The use of reinforcement learning within data assimilation is an area likely to see considerable growth; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b331">[311,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b214">194]</ref>. Approaches based on transportation of measure have shown recent promise in generalizing classic Kalman approaches and reducing their bias when applied to non-Gaussian problems. In particular, the paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b414">[394]</ref> introduces the approach of composing triangular transports as in Theorem 10.11 to build prior-to-posterior maps.</p><p>We conclude with some remarks on implementation issues that may arise when solving the optimization problems in this chapter. In order to evaluate the variational inference objective J(𝜃) in Section 10.2, the expectations can be replaced by empirical means. Additionally, the KL divergence must be computed. In some cases, such as with Gaussian densities, a closed form of the divergence is available: see Example 11.35, and identity <ref type="bibr">(11.18)</ref> in particular. Indeed Gaussian approximation is, in general, popular both because the interpretability of the mean and covariance, and because of the closed form for the divergence. In case only samples of 𝑞 𝑌 † 𝜃 are available (such as in an ensemble smoother), the divergence may be approximated by first applying density estimation to these samples. Finally, with all of the considered learning problems, the derivatives of J(𝜃) will generally be hard to obtain analytically. In this case, auto-differentiation can be applied, and then gradient-based methods used to minimize it. An example of using auto-differentiation in a similar context is provided in <ref type="bibr" target="#b296">[276]</ref>.</p><p>Note that propriety does not guarantee an accurate ranking of forecast distributions if the forecast distributions are evaluated on verifications with different levels of noise. To ensure this property, the scoring rule must be modified for each level of noise such that the expected score is the same as it would be if there were no noise. A scoring rule possessing this property is known as unbiased. </p></div>

Moreover, this coupling has the form in <ref type="bibr">(11.5)</ref>, which is induced by an optimal transport map 𝑔 ⋆ solving the corresponding Monge problem <ref type="bibr">(11.4)</ref>; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[147,</ref><ref type="bibr">Chapter 2]</ref> for this connection in the static setting under conditions on the measures and the cost function, as well as <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[48]</ref> for this connection in dynamic setting, which seeks a flow to define the transport map. Note that for 𝑝 &gt; 1 the objective in <ref type="bibr">(11.6</ref>) is strictly convex, and so the optimal transport map that solves 𝑊 𝑝 (𝜌, 𝜚) is also unique; however uniqueness does not extend to 𝑝 = 1; see Section 2.2 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b391">[371]</ref> for an example of lack of uniqueness of optimal transport maps for 𝑝 = 1. See also <ref type="bibr" target="#b391">[371,</ref><ref type="bibr">Section 2.2]</ref> for discussion of the optimality of the transport map used in the proof of Lemma 11.10.</p><p>The 𝜒 2 divergence arises naturally in the analysis of sampling algorithms that involve weighting samples according to the ratio between two densities. In that context, the 𝜒 2 divergence has a natural interpretation as quantifying the variance of the weights. The KL divergence has a distinguished place among f-divergences due to its appealing analytical and computational properties. The paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">[103]</ref> contains proof of the assertion made in Remark 11.36.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chapter 14</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Time-Series Forecasting</head><p>This chapter is devoted to the study of time series forecasting, with an emphasis on data-driven approaches. In most other chapters we have used 𝑛 to index data and 𝑗 to index (discrete) time in (possibly stochastic) dynamical systems. In this chapter the two are conflated as the data comes from a time series as follows:</p><p>For this reason the (possibly stochastic) dynamical systems in this chapter will be indexed by 𝑛, not 𝑗. Our focus in this chapter is to learn models that are consistent with the data in Data Assumption 14.1 and which may be used to predict future outcomes from points not in the data set. The first set of models we use are deterministic. In Section 14.1 we study analog forecasting methods, a deterministic forecasting methodology that seeks to predict from a given point by looking at what happened, in the data set, starting at nearby point(s). In Section 14.2 we look at fitting Markovian deterministic models to the data; we also study non-Markovian deterministic models, using a recurrent structure to capture memory dependence. In Section 14.3 we introduce linear autoregressive models, modelling the data as a Gaussian process. Section 14.4 introduces non-Gaussian autoregressive models, generalizing the content of Section 14.3 to a non-Gaussian setting using transport ideas. We conclude in Section 14.5 with bibliographic remarks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="14.1">Analog Forecasting</head><p>Assume that we are given time-series data set as in Data Assumption 14.1. The goal of forecasting is to predict 𝑣 𝑞 given 𝑣 0 , for 𝑞 ∈ N. Analog forecasting specifically operates by predicting, from given specific point 𝑣 0 , by looking for nearby points in the data set and using the evolution, in the data set, from those nearby points, to construct a forecast. </p></div>			</div>
