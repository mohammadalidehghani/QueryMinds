      "Introduction The term machine learning ( ML ) traditionally includes algorithms that are able to improve their performance on a specific task over time , given an increasing amount of relevant data [ 1 ] . In recent years , this field of research is enjoying a growing popularity , driven by the breakthrough of Deep Learning [ 2 ] and an impressive track record of success stories in different fields , ranging from natural language processing [ 3 ] to autonomous vehicles [ 4 ] , image classification [ 5 ] human-competitive performance in boardgames [ 6 ] . An interesting online collection about various uses of ML has been compiled by the journal Nature is late 2018 1 , although the fast pace the field is progressing made it to appear outdated after few quarters . As out-of-the-box ML solutions are becoming increasingly available to both researchers and the general public [ 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ] , theoretical questions are suddenly turning into practical issues .

The selection of the most effective ML algorithm is based on many factors , including the type , quantity , and quality of the training data , the availability of labelled data , the type of problem being addressed ( prediction , classification , and so on ) , the overall accuracy and performance required , and the hardware systems available for training and inferencing .

For instance , if a model is differentiating between images of cats and dogs , saliency maps could highlight the pixels most influential in the decision-making process . However , for complex and socially-embedded topics -such as biased healthcare algorithms -these model-centric explanations can fall short . Consider an algorithm that predicts hospital readmission risk but systematically underestimates it for certain racial groups . A model-centric explanation might highlight `` total healthcare costs incurred in the past year '' as an important feature . However , this alone might not fully reveal why the algorithm underestimates risk for a specific racial group . The algorithmic choice could come from the fact that this racial group , due to systemic inequities , have historically been unable to afford adequate healthcare and thus incurred lower costs . As a result , the low value for the `` total healthcare costs incurred in the past year '' feature does not necessarily indicate better health .",

This ambiguity complicates the evaluation and regulation of opaque ML systems , raising questions about what constitutes sufficient interpretation and how it should be assessed . A pragmatic and pluralistic approach to interpretability has gained traction , viewing explanations as context-dependent responses to why-questions [ 12 , 31 , 42 , 43 ] . On this pluralistic approach , the adequacy of an explanation depends on the specific inquiry . For simple classification tasks , techniques like saliency maps or feature importance may suffice .

Our paper expands the discourse on transparency in machine learning , arguing that it extends beyond model interpretability . We propose that in high-stake decision domains , a sociostructural analysis could be necessary to understand system outputs , uncover societal biases , ensure accountability , and guide policy decisions .",

We could perhaps consider the modeling perspective as the most crucial part of this conceptual architecture . Because if we do not use a proper perspective or perspectives to look at the meanings of a system , it is practically impossible for us to achieve a model , start modeling , and ultimately develop through engineering calculations . To obtain the proper perspective or perspectives of a system , we need human intuition of that system , meaning there is a deep connection between the modeler 's intuition and system engineering ( including software , hardware , and intelligence ) .

The key insight is that the learning performance can be expressed in terms of entropy derived from information theory.

This concept can be applied to various machine learning tasks, including classification, regression, and clustering. We provide a mathematical theorem establishing the connection between the empirically-defined similarity measure and information measures. This theorem is used to explain the relation between ITL and machine learning, as well as to formulate a conjecture for pursuing a unified mathematical interpretation of learning target selection. \n\nIn brief, the aim of this position paper is to provide a new operational definition of machine learning that emphasizes learning performance as a consequence of information theoretical learning, and to establish a mathematical theorem that explains the relation between ITL and machine learning.

In this paper , I argue for a more holistic interpretation in which finding more probable , efficient and abstract representations is as central to learning as performance . In other words , machine learning should be extended with strategies to reason over its own learning process , leading to so-called meta-cognitive machine learning . As such , the de facto definition of machine learning should be reformulated in these intrinsically multiobjective terms , taking into account not only the task performance but also internal learning objectives . To this end , we suggest a `` model entropy function '' to be defined that quantifies the efficiency of the internal learning processes .

Insurance , a technology for doing risk , transforms uncertainty into calculable risk ( Lehtonen & Van Hoyweghen , ) . The key idea is to share the risk of a loss in a collective , organized through an abstract mutuality ; due to the 'law ' of large numbers , uncertainty thus becomes manageable and the effect of chance can be offset ( Ewald , ) . In this way , insurance creates a `` community of fate '' in the face of uncertainty ( Heimer , ) . To enter into this community ( the insurance pool ) , the insurer demands a certain fee , called premium , from the policyholder . In insurance , questions of fairness inevitably arise , and have been the subject of much debate . The central point of debate is the tension between risk assessment and distribution ( Abraham , ) . In other words , who is to be mutualized in the pool .",
      "As a consequence , the functional behavior expected from data-driven components can only be specified in part on their intended domain , and we can not assure that they will behave as expected in all cases . Moreover , their processing structure is usually difficult to trace and validate by humans because this structure rarely follows human intuition but is generated to provide the algorithmically generalized input-output relationship in an effective manner . Prominent representatives of models used by data-driven components are artificial neural networks and support vector machines ( Russell & Norvig , 2016 ) . Since data-driven models are an important source of uncertainty in embedded systems that collaborate in an open context , the uncertainty they introduce has to be appropriately understood and managed during design time and runtime . Previous work ( Kläs & Vollmer , 2018 ) proposes separating the sources of uncertainty in data-driven components into three major classes , distinguishing between uncertainty caused by limitations in terms of model fit , data quality , and scope compliance ."

      "Introduction Machine Learning is a scientific discipline that is concerned with the design and development of algorithms that allow computers to `` learn data '' . More precisely , `` learn '' is here intended as the possibility to automatically recognize complex patterns and make `` intelligent '' decisions , based on information data . Hence , machine learning is closely related to fields such as statistics , probability theory , data mining , pattern recognition , artificial intelligence , adaptive control and theoretical computer science . Machine learning algorithms can be classified in the following types : • supervised learning algorithms : a function/classifier is generated , that maps outputs on the training inputs , based on labeled examples inputoutput ; • unsupervised learning algorithms : patterns in the input are recognized , the examples have no labels ; • semi-supervised learning algorithms : supervised and unsupervised learning information is combined ; • reinforcement learning : actions from observation of the world are generated . Every action has some impact in the environment and the environment provides feedbacks that are translated into a score that guide the learning process .",

This leaves a very large choice of ML algorithms for any given problem . In practice , the selection of an ML algorithm for a given scientific problem is more complex than just selecting one of the machine learning technologies and any particular algorithm . The selection of the most effective ML algorithm is based on many factors , including the type , quantity , and quality of the training data , the availability of labelled data , the type of problem being addressed ( prediction , classification , and so on ) , the overall accuracy and performance required , and the hardware systems available for training and inferencing .

However , the simulated data may not be representative of the real data and the model may therefore not perform satisfactorily when used for inferencing . The unsupervised learning technique , in contrast , does not rely on labels . A simple example of this technique is clustering , where the aim is to identify several groups of data points that have common features . Another example is identification of anomalies in data . Example algorithms include k-Means Clustering 8 , Support Vector Machines ( SVM ) 9 , or neural network-based autoencoders 10 .

      "Introduction Complex environments such as Go , Starcraft , and many modern video-games present profound challenges in deep reinforcement learning that have yet to be solved . They often require long , precise sequences of actions and domain knowledge in order to obtain reward , and have yet to be learned from random weight initialization . Solutions to these problems would mark a significant breakthrough on the path to artificial general intelligence . Recent works in reinforcement learning have shown that environments such as Atari games [ 2 ] can be learned from pixel input to superhuman expertise [ 9 ] . The agents start with randomly initialized weights , and learn largely from trial and error , relying on a reward signal to indicate performance . Despite these successes , complex games , including those where rewards are sparse such as Montezuma 's Revenge , have been notoriously difficult to learn . While methods such as intrinsic motivation [ 3 ] have been used to partially overcome these challenges , we suspect this becomes intractable as complexity increases . Additionally , as environments become more complex , they will become more expensive to simulate .",

      "We present and demonstrate a novel continual learning method we call incremental learning to solve complex environments . In incremental learning , environments are framed as a task to be learned by an agent . This task can be split into a series of subtasks that are solved simultaneously . Similar to how natural language processing and object detection are subtasks of neural image caption generation [ 23 ] , reinforcement learning environments also have subtasks relevant to a given environment . These subtasks often include player detection , player control , obstacle detection , enemy detection , and player-object interaction , to name a few . These subtasks are common to many environments , but they are often sufficiently different in function and representation that reinforcement learning algorithms fail to generalize them across environments , such as in Atari .

      "INTRODUCTION In order to formulate a learning theory of machine learning , it may be necessary to move from seeing an inert model as the machine learner to seeing the human developer-along with , and not separate from , his or her model and surrounding social relations-as the machine learner . -Reigeluth & Castelle [ 55 ] The past decade has seen massive research on interpretable machine learning ( ML ) . 1 Here is a rough restatement of the goal of interpretable ML research program : many ML models are opaque in that even the expert humans can not robustly understand , in non-mathematical terms , the reasons for why particular outputs are generated by these models [ 31 , 42 , 66 ] . To overcome this opacity , various model-centric techniques have been developed to interpret their outputs . These techniques are diverse . They range from producing counterfactual explanations or heatmaps that offer insights into how changing inputs affect outputs [ 28 , 41 , 46 ] , to interpreting the inner workings of the model by probing patterns of neuron activations or attention mechanisms [ 10 , 15 , 48 ] .",
      "What is it to interpret the outputs of an opaque machine learning model ? One approach is to develop interpretable machine learning techniques . These techniques aim to show how machine learning models function by providing either model-centric local or global explanations , which can be based on mechanistic interpretations ( revealing the inner working mechanisms of models ) or non-mechanistic approximations ( showing input feature-output data relationships ) . In this paper , we draw on social philosophy to argue that interpreting machine learning outputs in certain normatively-salient domains could require appealing to a third type of explanation that we call `` socio-structural '' explanation . The relevance of this explanation type is motivated by the fact that machine learning models are not isolated entities but are embedded within and shaped by social structures . Socio-structural explanations aim to illustrate how social structures contribute to and partially explain the outputs of machine learning models . We demonstrate the importance of socio-structural explanations by examining a racially biased healthcare allocation algorithm .",

We propose incorporating relevant socio-structural explanations to achieve a deeper understanding of ML outputs in domains with substantial societal impact . In the rest of the paper , we introduce the concept of socio-structural explanations and discuss their relevance to understanding ML outputs . We then examine how these explanations can enhance the interpretation of automated decision-making by ML systems in healthcare [ 49 ] . Our paper expands the discourse on transparency in machine learning , arguing that it extends beyond model interpretability .

These solutions are typically based on an understanding of the underlying concepts of fairness, and may involve methods such as fair sampling, fair partitioning, or fair training of models. For example, fair sampling may require that a sample of the population be used to train a model, rather than all of the population, to ensure that the model is fair to all members of the population. Fair partitioning may require that a model be trained on subsets of the population with different characteristics, so that the model is fair to those with different characteristics. Fair training of models involves ensuring that the training dataset is representative of the population, so that the model is fair to all members of the population.\n\nCalibration is a more complex approach to fairness, and involves ensuring that the model accurately predicts the probability of an event given the features of an individual.

So we look at a system under modeling from one or several perspectives , and we discover a set of meanings about that system . Using the modeling language and tool , we express and record those perceived meanings of the system . This allows us to engineer the system under modeling ( as-is system or to-be system ) by changing and transforming it . We could perhaps consider the modeling perspective as the most crucial part of this conceptual architecture .",
      "and managed during design time and runtime . Previous work ( Kläs & Vollmer , 2018 ) proposes separating the sources of uncertainty in data-driven components into three major classes , distinguishing between uncertainty caused by limitations in terms of model fit , data quality , and scope compliance . Whereas model fit focuses on the inherent uncertainty in data-driven models , data quality covers the additional uncertainty caused by their application to input data obtained in suboptimal conditions and scope compliance covers situations where the model is likely applied outside the scope for which it was trained and validated ."
