      "Introduction Machine learning usually aims to find and develop a computational model for an intelligent task on a practical problem . Development based on calculation can be called engineering ( 1 ) . In software engineering , software systems are calculated and engineered by models . In fact , these software models are platforms for analysis , design , development , and system engineering . For modeling in software engineering , we need several elements : 1 . The modeling perspective , 2 . The system under modeling , and 3 . Modeling language and tools ( 5 ) . So we look at a system under modeling from one or several perspectives , and we discover a set of meanings about that system . Using the modeling language and tool , we express and record those perceived meanings of the system . This allows us to engineer the system under modeling ( as-is system or to-be system ) by changing and transforming it . We could perhaps consider the modeling perspective as the most crucial part of this conceptual architecture . Because if we do not use a proper perspective or perspectives to look at the meanings of a system , it is practically impossible for us to achieve a model , start modeling , and ultimately develop through engineering calculations .",
      "As a consequence , the functional behavior expected from data-driven components can only be specified in part on their intended domain , and we can not assure that they will behave as expected in all cases . Moreover , their processing structure is usually difficult to trace and validate by humans because this structure rarely follows human intuition but is generated to provide the algorithmically generalized input-output relationship in an effective manner . Prominent representatives of models used by data-driven components are artificial neural networks and support vector machines ( Russell & Norvig , 2016 ) . Since data-driven models are an important source of uncertainty in embedded systems that collaborate in an open context , the uncertainty they introduce has to be appropriately understood and managed during design time and runtime . Previous work ( Kläs & Vollmer , 2018 ) proposes separating the sources of uncertainty in data-driven components into three major classes , distinguishing between uncertainty caused by limitations in terms of model fit , data quality , and scope compliance . Whereas model fit focuses on the inherent uncertainty in data-driven models , data quality covers the additional uncertainty caused by their application to input data obtained in suboptimal conditions and scope compliance covers situations where the model is likely applied outside the scope for which it was trained and validated .",

The overarching scope of ML in science is very broad , including identifying patterns , anomalies , and trends from relevant scientific datasets , and using ML for classification and predicting of those patterns , clustering of data , and generating near-realistic synthetic data . There are three approaches for developing ML-based solutions , namely , supervised , unsupervised , and reinforcement learning . In supervised learning , the ML model is trained for a given task with examples . In order to have examples , the data used for training the ML model must contain the ground truth or labels . Supervised learning is therefore only possible when there is a labelled subset of the data . Once trained , the learned model can be deployed for real-time usage , such as pattern classification or estimation -- -which is often referred to as inference . Because of the difficulty in generating labelled data for supervised learning , particularly for experimental datasets , it is often difficult to apply supervised learning directly . To circumvent this limitation , training is often performed on simulated data , which provides an opportunity to have relevant labels .",

      "INTRODUCTION The age of rapid technological change is unfolding in real time , empowering the collection of massive amounts of data in a variety of fields . Despite this , many fields still struggle with data acquisition with limited sample sizes , particularly in experiments that involve human or animal subjects and can be prohibitively expensive . To improve the performance of the primary task on those occasions , transfer learning has been widely advocated as a means of leveraging knowledge from available auxiliary data that are different while related to the primary data . Successful applications of transfer learning in data-scarce fields include drug development ( Turki , Wei , & Wang 2017 ) , clinical trials ( Bellot & van der Schaar 2019 ) , and material sciences ( Hutchinson et al . 2017 ) , among others . For an overview of transfer learning methodologies and applications , interested readers may refer to survey papers by Pan and Yang ( 2009 ) , Weiss , Khoshgoftaar , and Wang ( 2016 ) , Niu , Liu , Wang , and Song ( 2020 ) , and Zhuang et al .

    "answer": "Theoretical analysis (e.g., proofs or bounds) is a tool used to help the engineer to reason about an engineering problem. Once an engineer has a good understanding of the problem, the engineer can then use the resulting theoretical knowledge to design and build an efficient solution. However, the engineer can only use theoretical knowledge to design an efficient solution if they have empirical evidence to support it. Therefore, empirical evidence is what the engineer needs to use to design an efficient solution.\n\nINTRODUCTION In the context of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), the concept of `` classification '' has become an integral part of the researches, especially in fields like Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Speech Recognition (NSSR). Classification, in its fundamental form, is a supervised learning technique that maps a set of input data into a finite number of classes (categories). The aim of classification is to provide a set of labels (or predictions) for each instance of the data set, which indicates the class or the category to which the instance belongs. In this paper, we propose a new approach for the classification of textual data using a combination of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a",

      "Among all common inquiries , perhaps the most basic is : can ML work on a specific problem ? Or , in other words : given the characteristics of a target data set , can the effectiveness of a ML approach be predicted ? Interestingly , this latter question can be further rephrased as : what are the characteristics of a data set that are well correlated with the possibility , or the impossibility , of obtaining ML models able to effectively extrapolate to unknown instances of the problem ? It is well known that ML algorithms are affected by the curse of dimensionality [ 11 ] , but ML practitioners also know that it could be possible to obtain reliable models even for high-dimensional data sets , and with a relatively small number of samples [ 12 ] . The common approach among practitioners in the field , when dealing with a new data set , seems to be : try as many different ML algorithms as possible in a cross-validation , and evaluate the outcomes ; then focus on the techniques that provided the best results , possibly applying them in an ensemble [ 13 ] .",
      "Introduction In an age of user generated web-contents and of portable devices with embedded computer vision capabilities , machine learning ( ML ) and big data mining questions are fundamental . As a result , these questions naturally penetrate neighboring research fields , including belief function theory ( BFT ) , so that it is now usual to attend a `` Classification '' session [ 26 ] or a `` Machine Learning '' session [ 16 ] in a conference devoted to belief functions . However , it is hard to accept that among the various proposed approaches based on BF , very few have become state-of-the-art ML methods , the knowledge of which has spread beyond the BF community . Without any doubt , this can be partly explained by the relative size of the scientific communities under consideration : although quickly growing , the BF one is relatively small with respect to that of statistics , Bayesian networks , neural networks , etc . However , this reason alone is not sufficient : There are indeed other topics , such as for instance , information fusion , where BF-based methods are now as well recognized as are methods based on more classical formalisms , such as probabilities , or ontologies .",

      "Introduction Machine learning is the study and construction of systems that can learn from data . The systems are called learning machines . When Big Data emerges increasingly , more learning machines are developed and applied in different domains . However , the ultimate goal of machine learning study is insight , not machine itself . By the term insight I mean learning mechanisms in descriptions of mathematical principles . In a loose sense , learning mechanisms can be regarded as the natural entity . As the `` Tao ( 道 ) '' reflects the most fundamental of the universe by Lao Tzu ( 老子 ) , Einstein suggests that we should pursue the simplest mathematical interpretations to the nature . Although learning mechanisms are related to the subjects of psychology , cognitive and brain science , this paper stresses on the exploration of mathematical principles for interpretation of learning mechanisms . Up to now , we human beings are still far away from deep understanding ourself on learning mechanisms in terms of mathematical principles . It is the author 's belief that `` mathematical-principle-based machine '' might be more important and critical than `` brain-inspired machine '' in the study of machine learning .

      "Introduction Complex environments such as Go , Starcraft , and many modern video-games present profound challenges in deep reinforcement learning that have yet to be solved . They often require long , precise sequences of actions and domain knowledge in order to obtain reward , and have yet to be learned from random weight initialization . Solutions to these problems would mark a significant breakthrough on the path to artificial general intelligence . Recent works in reinforcement learning have shown that environments such as Atari games [ 2 ] can be learned from pixel input to superhuman expertise [ 9 ] . The agents start with randomly initialized weights , and learn largely from trial and error , relying on a reward signal to indicate performance . Despite these successes , complex games , including those where rewards are sparse such as Montezuma 's Revenge , have been notoriously difficult to learn . While methods such as intrinsic motivation [ 3 ] have been used to partially overcome these challenges , we suspect this becomes intractable as complexity increases . Additionally , as environments become more complex , they will become more expensive to simulate . This poses a significant problem , since many Atari games already require upwards of 100 million steps using state-of-the-art algorithms , representing days of training on a single machine .",

This poses a significant problem , since many Atari games already require upwards of 100 million steps using state-of-the-art algorithms , representing days of training on a single machine . Thus , it appears likely that complex environments will become too costly to learn from randomly initialized weights , due both to the increased simulation cost as well as the inherent difficulty of the task . Therefore , some form of prior information must be given to the agent . This can be seen with AlphaGo [ 18 ] , where the agent never learned to play the game without first using supervised learning on human games . While supervised learning certainly has been shown to aid reinforcement learning , it is very costly to obtain sufficient samples and requires the environment to be a task humans can play with reasonable skill , and is therefore impractical for a wide variety of important reinforcement learning problems . In this paper we introduce Dex , the first continual reinforcement learning toolkit for training and evaluating continual learning methods .

      "Introduction Machine learning is often approached from a behaviourist perspective , in which external feedback in the form of a reinforcement signal is the major driving force of improvement . Though this method has lead to many successes , it is confronted with interesting and unsolved challenges like tackling overfitting , providing comprehensibility , building reusable abstractions and concept formation , among many other [ Kotsiantis et al. , 2007 ; Bengio , 2009 ] . The problem with these behaviourist approaches is that they ignore the central importance of internal processes when considering learning . Model internals are often regarded just as a means to achieve higher performance . Analogous to studying human behaviour , however , appreciating the mechanisms of learning boils down to the question : `` when have we really learnt ? '' In this paper , we argue that a computer has learnt when : • the programme becomes better at the task at hand ; • the programme can perform the task more efficiently ; • the code becomes `` more structured '' and simpler . One possible analogy to better understand the above statements can be found in software engineering . When considering code that performs a specific task , we do not care only about its functionality , but also about its execution speed/efficiency and other so-called `` non-functional requirements '' ."

Robustness to distribution shift means that the model will produce reliable predictions even when the training data distribution changes. Robustness to noise refers to the ability of the model to handle noise in the input data. Adversarial perturbations refer to changes in the input data that mimic the behavior of an adversary, and may result in misclassification. Robustness to adversarial perturbations is a crucial aspect of machine learning, as adversarial attacks can produce incorrect predictions that can cause safety-critical systems to malfunction.

These methods can be model-centric or non-model-centric. Model-centric methods aim to explain the decision-making process by viewing the model as a black box.

This ambiguity complicates the evaluation and regulation of opaque ML systems , raising questions about what constitutes sufficient interpretation and how it should be assessed . A pragmatic and pluralistic approach to interpretability has gained traction , viewing explanations as context-dependent responses to why-questions [ 12 , 31 , 42 , 43 ] . On this pluralistic approach , the adequacy of an explanation depends on the specific inquiry . For simple classification tasks , techniques like saliency maps or feature importance may suffice . For instance , if a model is differentiating between images of cats and dogs , saliency maps could highlight the pixels most influential in the decision-making process . However , for complex and socially-embedded topics -such as biased healthcare algorithms -these model-centric explanations can fall short . Consider an algorithm that predicts hospital readmission risk but systematically underestimates it for certain racial groups . A model-centric explanation might highlight `` total healthcare costs incurred in the past year '' as an important feature . However , this alone might not fully reveal why the algorithm underestimates risk for a specific racial group .",

      "Introduction The ethics of Machine Learning has become an unavoidable topic in the AI Community . The deployment of machine learning systems in multiple social contexts has resulted in a closer ethical scrutiny of the design , development , and application of these systems . The AI/ML community has come to terms with the imperative to think about the ethical implications of machine learning , not only as a product but also as a practice ( Birhane , 2021 ; Shen et al . 2021 ) . The critical question that is troubling many debates is what can constitute an ethically accountable machine learning system . In this paper we explore possibilities for ethical evaluation of machine learning methodologies . We scrutinize techniques , methods and technical practices in machine learning from a relational ethics perspective , taking into consideration how machine learning systems are part of the world and how they relate to different forms of agency . Taking a page from Phil Agre ( 1997 ) we use the notion of a critical technical practice as a means of analysis of machine learning approaches . Our radical proposal is that supervised learning appears to be the only machine learning method that is ethically defensible .",
      "Briefly , actuarial fairness demands that each policyholder should pay only for their own risk , that is , mutualization should occur only between individuals with the same 'true ' risk . In contrast , solidarity calls for equal contribution to the pool . On one level of this text , we problematize actuarial fairness ( by extension , calibration ) as a notion of fairness in the normative sense by taking inspiration from insurance . This perspective is aligned with recent proposals that stress the discrepancy of formal algorithmic fairness and `` substantive '' fairness ( Green , ) , which some prefer to call justice ( Vredenburgh , ) . Parallel to this runs a distinct textual level , where we emphasize two intricately interacting themes : responsibility and tensions between aggregate and individual . Both entail criticism of actuarial fairness , but we suggest that they additionally provide much broader , fruitful lessons for machine learning from insurance . At the highest level of abstraction , our goal is to establish a general conceptual bridge between insurance and machine learning . Traversing this bridge , machine learning scholars can obtain new perspectives on the social situatedness of a probabilistic , statistical technology -we attempt to offer a new 'cognitive toolkit ' for thinking about the social situatedness of machine learning .",
      "In other words , who is to be mutualized in the pool . Some form of segmentation is found in many insurantial arrangements : the pool of policyholders can be stratified by separating high and low risk individuals . But the specific nature that such segmentation McFall et al . ( ) call insurance `` interestingly uninteresting '' , referring to how insurance is `` hugely underresearched '' given its societal importance , which is typically not recognized ( Ewald , ) . takes typically depends not only on risk assessment , but on further considerations such as assignment of responsibility , modulated by social context ; in this way , insurance is not a neutral technology ( Baker & Simon , ; Glenn , a ) . Our non-comprehensive outline of the history of insurance illustrates how uncertainty , fairness and responsibility interact , and can be entangled and disentangled . From this background , we can extract conceptual insights which also apply to machine learning . The tension between risk assessment and distribution is mirrored in formal fairness principles : solidarity , which can be linked to independence in fair machine learning , contrasts with actuarial fairness , linked to calibration . Briefly , actuarial fairness demands that each policyholder should pay only for their own risk , that is , mutualization should occur only between individuals with the same 'true ' risk .",
      "Introduction Insurance is `` interestingly uninteresting '' . In this work , we argue that in fact insurance is far from uninteresting and indeed a rich source of inspiration and insight to scholarship interested in social issues surrounding machine learning , specifically the field now known as fair machine learning . Our proposal is that insurance can be viewed as an analogon to machine learning with respect to these issues arising from the social situatedness . While machine learning is a relatively recent technology , debates regarding social issues in the context of insurance have been ongoing for a long time . Thus , we argue that taking inspiration from studies of insurance can contribute to a more integrative view of machine learning systems as socio-technical systems ( Selbst et al. , ) . Both machine learning and insurance are firmly based on a statistical , probabilistic mode of reasoningan actuarial mode . Indeed , insurance can be viewed as the first commercial test of probability theory ( Gigerenzer et al. , ; McFall , ) . Insurance , a technology for doing risk , transforms uncertainty into calculable risk ( Lehtonen & Van Hoyweghen , ) ."

    "question": "What limitations are commonly identified, and what future directions or open problems follow from them?",
    "answer": "Limitations: \n- Fault tolerance: In general, quantum computers are not fault-tolerant, meaning that they can go out of sync and lose data after a certain point. This means that quantum algorithms may fail if they make incorrect predictions or if they are subject to noise or other random events. - Quantum noise: Quantum noise can be as bad as classical noise, and quantum computers can be more sensitive to noise than classical computers. This means that quantum algorithms may become computationally intractable or infeasible in certain cases. - Quantum memory: Quantum memories are not yet practical, but they have the potential to improve the performance of quantum algorithms. - Quantum entanglement: Entanglement is a special kind of quantum correlation that can be used to improve the performance of quantum algorithms. However, entanglement can also be destroyed by noise, making it difficult to use entanglement for large-scale quantum computations. Future directions:\n- Fault-tolerance: One way to address the limitations of quantum computers is to develop more robust and fault-tolerant quantum algorithms. One approach is to use quantum error correction codes, which can help protect against certain types of errors that may occur",

      "Among all common inquiries , perhaps the most basic is : can ML work on a specific problem ? Or , in other words : given the characteristics of a target data set , can the effectiveness of a ML approach be predicted ? Interestingly , this latter question can be further rephrased as : what are the characteristics of a data set that are well correlated with the possibility , or the impossibility , of obtaining ML models able to effectively extrapolate to unknown instances of the problem ? It is well known that ML algorithms are affected by the curse of dimensionality [ 11 ] , but ML practitioners also know that it could be possible to obtain reliable models even for high-dimensional data sets , and with a relatively small number of samples [ 12 ] . The common approach among practitioners in the field , when dealing with a new data set , seems to be : try as many different ML algorithms as possible in a cross-validation , and evaluate the outcomes ; then focus on the techniques that provided the best results , possibly applying them in an ensemble [ 13 ] .",

      "In addition to discussing the current applications of quantum capabilities for machine learning , we should also let our imaginations soar . The era of fault-tolerant quantum computing ( FTQC ) is a foreseeable future , and it 's crucial to look ahead at what challenges we can tackle with quantum machine learning on FTQC devices . One of the most renowned and valuable algorithms in this context is the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd ( HHL ) algorithm [ 58 ] . Additionally , there are other algorithms that can be deployed to address a range of problems , such as principal component analysis [ 18 ] . Beside the optimistic future that quantum machine learning has , there are also a number of controversial issues with the subject . For example , some might argue that the variational quantum algorithm will not work in some circumstance . People working on quantum landscapes theory observed the famous barren plateau phenomena which leads to a kind of no-go theorem [ 27 , 86 ] . It amounts to situations that are hard to find minimum when we optimizes our objective function by gradient descent with randomized variational circuits . Debates indeed exist regarding whether quantum algorithms can consistently deliver exponential speedups . Some argue that quantum speedup is only guaranteed when dealing with quantum information ."

    "answer": "Real-world constraints shape machine learning systems used for decision-making in several ways:\n\n1. Deployment: If the system needs to be deployed in real-time, the constraints may dictate the hardware and software infrastructure needed.

In some cases, the system may need to be deployed in a particular geographic location, and the cost of infrastructure and deployment may be prohibitive.\n\n3.

      "Introduction The term machine learning ( ML ) traditionally includes algorithms that are able to improve their performance on a specific task over time , given an increasing amount of relevant data [ 1 ] .

An infinite number of neural networks with very similar or identical decision boundaries can be constructed -of which two are shown in Fig . 2 . From an external point of view , there is no way to discriminate between these two models : describing the difference between these two models can only occur in terms of the model internals . Of course the weight space , which represents the model of a neural network , is related to the data space , as it performs calculations on the data .

When considering code that performs a specific task , we do not care only about its functionality , but also about its execution speed/efficiency and other so-called `` non-functional requirements '' . Furthermore , a carefully modularized design probably reflects more understanding than an endless enumeration of IF-ELSE clauses . In other words , finding a more efficient and structured way to represent/reproduce information and to perform a learning task , is as central to machine learning as the reproduction of results . Different to humans , of course , machines are measurable . This provides us with a unique opportunity to study the nature of learning in principle , at the same time improving Machine Intelligence . We are not claiming that model complexity/efficiency has not been subject to past research efforts . On the contrary , many techniques and design principles have attempted to improve exactly these properties -like Occam 's razor , Bayesian structure learning , pruning , the use of prototypes to compact information , regularization as a strategy to reduce energy , weight sharing in RNNs or CNNs to decrease model complexity , etc . Indeed , the whole evolution of Deep Learning can be seen as one specific approach in the quest to find models that are more structured ( i.e .",
      "Introduction Machine learning usually aims to find and develop a computational model for an intelligent task on a practical problem . Development based on calculation can be called engineering ( 1 ) . In software engineering , software systems are calculated and engineered by models . In fact , these software models are platforms for analysis , design , development , and system engineering . For modeling in software engineering , we need several elements : 1 . The modeling perspective , 2 . The system under modeling , and 3 . Modeling language and tools ( 5 ) . So we look at a system under modeling from one or several perspectives , and we discover a set of meanings about that system . Using the modeling language and tool , we express and record those perceived meanings of the system . This allows us to engineer the system under modeling ( as-is system or to-be system ) by changing and transforming it . We could perhaps consider the modeling perspective as the most crucial part of this conceptual architecture . Because if we do not use a proper perspective or perspectives to look at the meanings of a system , it is practically impossible for us to achieve a model , start modeling , and ultimately develop through engineering calculations .",
      "Traditional machine learning techniques typically exploit shallow-structured , and often fixed , architectures . Nevertheless , there is a general consensus that the learning of `` higherorder '' concepts is problematic , and that the solution to this issue is somehow connected to deep architectures that create ever higher forms of abstraction . Experimental research as well as neurological evidence on the organization of the brain , supports this finding [ Bianchini and Scarselli , 2014 ] . The limitation of architecture complexity is preferred , primarily because their behaviour could be understood and the training of more complex or adaptive architectures leads to a explosion of complexity . That was until recently . The recent advanced in so-called `` Deep Learning '' , have focused on training algorithms that are adapted to new kinds of deep architectures [ Deng and Yu , 2014 ] , and heuristic strategies to attain specific structural properties like sparse coding that lead to higher forms of abstractions . With the exception of studies on `` interpretability '' [ Jin and Sendhoff , 2008 ] , structural properties are mainly considered a by-product , a ( desirable ) side effect of the applied training mechanisms .
